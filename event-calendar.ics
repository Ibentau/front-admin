SUMMARY:[MODELS Tutorials] Ontology modeling language - Maged Elaasar
DESCRIPTION:Ontological Modeling Language This tutorial will present the ontological approach to systems modeling and analysis using the Ontological Modeling Language (OML )\, developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)\, and contributed through the openCAESAR project. We will first give a brief overview of OML\, its history\, its architecture\, and its tool ecosystem. Then\, we will hold a number of short hands-on labs where we will give attendees some experience with working with OML and its tools. This will include developing a semantic vocabulary\, using it to describe a system\, and analyzing the system description for consistency using a logical reasoner\, a set of queries\, and a UI viewpoint. Familiarity with using the Eclipse IDE would greatly help. Some background in system modeling\, with languages like UML or SysML\, and some knowledge about semantic web would also help but is not essential. Following the tutorial’s installation instructions documented on the tutorial web page beforehand would be greatly appreciated. \nSpeaker/s Biography: Maged Elaasar is a Senior Computer Scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech)\, where he technically leads a strategic R&amp\;D program called Integrated Model Centric Engineering (IMCE). The mission of the program is to transform Systems Engineering into a rigorous\, agile\, and data-centric practice\, and infuse it in JPL’s space missions. Dr. Elaasar also leads the openCAESAR open-source project that provides many of IMCE’s innovations\, like the Ontological Modeling Language (OML)\, not only to JPL but to the industry at large (including players from the aerospace\, defense and automotive domains). Prior to that\, Dr. Elaasar was a Senior Software Architect at IBM\, where he led the R&amp\;D of several commercial software and systems modeling tools (like Rational Software Architect) for 15 years. He also represents JPL (and previously IBM) at the Object Management Group where he has led several standards (including UML). Dr. Elaasar is also a part-time lecturer at the CS department of the University of California\, Los Angeles (UCLA) where he teaches Software Engineering. He is also the founder of Modelware Solutions\, a consulting company in model-based engineering (MBE) with several international clients. Dr. Elaasar holds a B.Sc. (AUC ’96) and M.Sc. (Carleton ’03) in Computer Science\, and a Ph.D. (Carleton ’12) in Computer Systems Engineering. He has published over 75 peer-reviewed papers and 12 US patents.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Tutorials] Discrete-Event Modeling and Simulation-based Development of Embedded Systems - Gabriel A. Wainer\, Cristina Ruiz Martin
DESCRIPTION:Discrete-Event Modeling and Simulation-based Development of Embedded Systems \nEmbedded real-time software construction has usually posed challenges due to the complexity of the tasks these systems have to execute. Most methods for developing embedded real-time systems require complex verification and validation efforts with no guarantee for bug-free software products. Although formal methods have showed shown promising results\, they are difficult to apply when the complexity of the system under development scales up. Instead\, systems engineers have often relied on the use of modeling and simulation (M&amp\;S) techniques to make system development tasks manageable. Construction of system models and their analysis through simulation reduces both end costs and risks\, while enhancing system capabilities and improving the quality of the final products. M&amp\;S let users experiment with “virtual” systems\, allowing them to explore changes\, and test dynamic conditions in a risk-free environment. This is a useful approach\, moreover\, considering that testing under actual operating conditions may be impractical and\, in some cases\, impossible. In this tutorial\, we will present a Modeling and Simulation-based framework to develop embedded systems based on the DEVS (Discrete EVent systems Specification) formalism. DEVS provides a formal foundation to M&amp\;S that combines the advantages of a simulation-based approach with the rigor of a formal methodology. We will discuss how to use this framework to incrementally develop embedded applications\, and to integrate simulation models with hardware components seamlessly. The use of DEVS improves reliability (in terms of logical correctness and timing)\, enables model reuse\, and permits reducing development and testing times for the overall process. Consequently\, the development cycle could be shortened\, its cost reduced\, and quality and reliability of the final product improved. One of the main aspects of the methodology is that it can be integrated with models of the environment in which the embedded controller will act. Our approach does not impose any order in the deployment of the actual hardware components\, providing flexibility to the overall process. \nSpeaker/s Biography: Gabriel Wainer\, FSCS\, is Full Professor in the Department of Systems and Computer Engineering at Carleton University (Ottawa\, ON\, Canada). He has held visiting positions at the University of Arizona\; LSIS (CNRS)\, Université Paul Cézanne\, University of Nice\, INRIA Sophia-Antipolis\, Université de Bordeaux (France)\; UCM\, UPM\, UPC (Spain)\, and others. He is one of the founders of SIMUTools\, ANNSIM (SCS/IEEE/ACM)\, the Symposium on Theory of Modeling and Simulation (SCS/ACM/IEEE)\, and Symposium on Simulation in Architecture and Urban Design - SimAUD (SCS/ACM/IEEE). Prof. Wainer was Vice-President Conferences and Vice-President Publications and is a member of the Board of Directors of the SCS\, Society for Modeling and Simulation International. He has published over 450 research articles and five books in the field of Modeling and Simulation\, and edited 13 Conference Proceedings. Prof. Wainer is Editor in Chief of SIMULATION\, member of the Editorial Board of Journal of Simulation (Taylor and Francis)\, IEEE Computing in Science and Engineering\, Wireless Networks (Elsevier). He is the head of the Advanced Real-time Simulation lab\, located at Carleton University’s Centre for advanced Simulation and Visualization (V- Sim). He helped organizing over 150 conferences\, being the Program Chair of the first ACM SIGSIM PADS and the 50th Winter Simulation Conference. He has been the recipient of various awards\, including the IBM Eclipse Innovation\, SCS Leadership\, and various Best Papers. He has received numerous awards\, including most notably recent awards such as Nepean’s Canada 150th Anniversary Medal (2017)\, ACM Recognition of Service Award (2018)\, IEEE Outstanding Engineering Award (Ottawa Section - 2019) and the McLeod Outstanding Service Award (SCS\, 2022). He is an ACM Distinguished Speaker and a Fellow of SCS. \nCristina Ruiz Martin is an Instructor at the Department of Systems and Computer Engineering at Carleton University (Ottawa\, ON\, Canada). She received the DEVS Modeling and Simulation Ph.D. Dissertation Award from SCS (2019) and the Young Simulation Scientist Award from SCS (2020).

SUMMARY:[MODELS Tutorials] Digital Twin as a Decision-Making Aid in the Face of Uncertainty - Vinay Kulkarni\, Souvik Barat\, Tony Clark\, Balbir Barn
DESCRIPTION:Digital Twin as a Decision-Making Aid in the Face of Uncertainty \nYou have heard extensively about digital twins and how they can be applied in a range of domains and for a range of different purposes. A particularly pressing problem that you are wrestling with is understanding how digital twin technology can be applied to aid in your decision-making requirements in the context of uncertainty. Do you need help in understanding how digital twins can be used? This introductory tutorial provides you with a detailed understanding of why digital twins are an important technology for exploring the unique phenomena of complex socio-cyber-economic ecosystems. The tutorial presents a critical analysis of the current state of the art and practice of digital twins in decision making and includes a focus on our actor-based language called Enterprise Simulation Language (ESL). This language is an example of an infrastructure for developing these digital twins for complex systems decision making. The tutorial helps you understand how ESL and related technologies can be used effectively by presenting multiple examples of real-world use of ESL to build digital twins. Problems addressed by these examples include: COVID-19 intervention planning\, return to work planning post COVID-19\, customer lifetime value optimization in the telecoms industry\, and supply chain. \nParticipants will get introduced to the concept of Digital Twin as it is seen in Business\, Cyber-physical and Socio-techno-economic spaces. Participants will get exposed to the core technology infrastructure needed to support Digital Twin as a decision-making aid. They will learn how digital twin possibly accompanied by reinforcement learning has been used to support quantitative evidence-backed decision-making in several real-world use cases two of which resonate very well with the conference theme of “modelling for social good”. \nSpeaker/s Biography: Vinay Kulkarni is Distinguished Chief Scientist and Head of Software Systems &amp\; Services research at Tata Consultancy Services. His research interests include digital twins\, adaptive enterprises\, learning-native software systems\, model-driven software engineering\, and enterprise modelling. Alumnus of IIT Madras\, Vinay serves as a Visiting Professor at Aston University Birmingham\, Middlesex University London\, and IIT Jodhpur.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Tutorials] From System Engineering to Analysis and Design for the Best Digital Products Engineering - Saulius Pavalkis
DESCRIPTION:From System Engineering to Analysis and Design for the Best Digital Products Engineering \nIn this session\, we present the state of the art of ongoing major activity integrating MBSE with SysML together with design\, analysis and model management capabilities in PLM engineering and business model based enterprise environment. We will share 30 years of ongoing effort integrating UML and SysML Object Management Group (OMG) standard based software and systems modeling solutions. This includes mapping data\, leveraging interchange and modeling standards. Result of work contributes to new version of the UML\, SysML and interchange standards. Specifically\, the session will present work in state of the art integrations between SysML and PLM. This contributes to Model based Systems Engineering ecosystem expansion and digital engineering strategy support. This is enabled by increased popularity of modeling standards for systems engineering which introduced formality in discipline and ability to apply semantically rich mapping between modeling of different disciplines like system engineering\, analysis\, design and requirements. We will demonstrate work done with Cameo / CATIA Magic – SysML modeling tool\, and 3DEXPERIENCE by Dassault Systèmes PLM platform. Even though a specific software is used all the integration methods and workflow is universal and can be applied for other tools. We will cover five major integration points including optimal metamodels mapping\, workflow\, and integration method. We cover system architecture in SysML and: 1. Requirements Management 2. Product Lines Engineering (PLE) and variants management 3. Simulation\, workflow automation\, optimization 4. Design continuity 5. Traceability and baselines \nSpeaker/s Biography: Saulius Pavalkis has 20 years of MBSE solutions experience\, product owner and analyst at Cameo core team\, chief solution architect\, consultant\, and trainer. Throughout his career\, he has been actively involved in building excellent MBSE ecosystem solutions in aerospace\, defense\, automotive and other areas. Former affiliate for JPL NASA for MBSE consulting\, contractor for Boeing MBSE transformation. Saulius contributed to MBSE SysML based method and framework MagicGrid book and recent “Agile MBSE Coocbook” book by Bruce Douglas. Guides 2000 subscribers - the largest SysML systems simulation community (youtube.com/c/MBSEExecution). Through the work accumulated major experience in systems modeling\, simulation\, MBSE ecosystem\, interfaces and integrations\, traceability\, queries. Saulius has INCOSE CSEP\, OMG OCSMP\, No Magic lifetime modeling and simulation excellence award.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Educators Symposium] A New DSL Textbook in Town! - Thorsten Berger
DESCRIPTION:DSLs are the ultimate abstraction in software engineering. While programming languages have – since the advent of computers – continuously increased their level of abstraction\, they are still limited to the domain of computing\, with their instances containing many technicalities. Unlike programming languages\, DSLs reflect a given application domain\, ideally abstracting away anything beyond it. Recognizing their strengths\, the programming-language and the software- engineering community introduced many technologies for engineering DSLs. While well- polished widely-used DSLs have existed for a long time (e.g.\, SQL\, regular expressions\, HTML)\, language engineering technologies have made great progress over the last two decades\, allowing developers who are not language or compiler experts to create their own DSL – in order to increase the level of automation for their projects. In the keynote\, I will report on our decade of experiences from teaching DSL engineering. I will especially present our recent book (see http://dsl.design). Andrzej Wasowski and I wrote it to: \n \n (i) establish more of an engineering perspective for creating DSLs\, teaching the problem-oriented creation of DSLs and different engineering activities including testing and requirements (domain analysis)\; \n (ii) bring the programming language and software-engineering community together by teaching solutions from both fields – many of which overlap conceptually – and thereby unifying and integrating them\; \n (iii) demonstrate how to use a modern functional and object-oriented language\, Scala\, to engineer internal and external DSLs\, while not limiting the presentation to a single programming language \n (iv) provide a large number of exercises (277 in total) for effective learning\, like mathematics textbooks do\; and \n (v) contribute a large number of examples where DSLs are effective\, with a whole chapter on DSLs for creating software platforms (a.k.a. product lines). \n \n \nShort bio: Thorsten Berger is a Professor in Computer Science at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. His research focuses on automating software engineering for the next generation of intelligent\, autonomous\, and variant-rich software systems -- exploring new ways of software creation\, analysis\, and evolution. Thorsten Berger received the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Leipzig in Germany in 2013\, supported by a scholarship from the German National Academic Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes). He was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Waterloo in Canada and the IT University of Copenhagen in Denmark\, and then an Associate Professor jointly at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. He received grants from the Swedish Research Council (competitive \nearly-career grant)\, the Wallenberg AI\, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)\, Vinnova Sweden (EU ITEA project)\, and the European Union (H2020 project). He received a fellowship from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Wallenberg Foundation\, one of the highest recognitions for researchers in Sweden. He received best-paper awards at the 2015 ACM SIGPLAN conference on MODULARITY and the 2013 European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering (CSMR\, now IEEE SANER)\, as well as a most influential paper award at the VaMoS'20 conference. His service was recognized with distinguished reviewer awards at the tier-one conferences ASE 2018 and ICSE 2020\, and the SPLC 2022 conference.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Educators Symposium] Tool Support for the Teaching of State-Based Behavior Modeling - Christian Zöllner\, Christian M Adriano\, Simon Wietheger\, Leen Lambers\, Holger Giese
DESCRIPTION:Modeling tools are commonly adopted in classrooms. However\, complex state-based behavioral models still pose a challenge for students to understand and validate\, mostly because of the intricate semantics of these models.We investigated this challenge and developed dedicated tool support in the form of a validation framework based on the YAKINDU Statechart Tools. Our validation framework simulates environments that interact with the code generated from statecharts as means to animate various open-ended scenarios and predefined test cases that challenge the students’ models. This enabled shorter and user-friendly feedback cycles\, which lowered the barrier for students to learn state-based behavioral models. We designed the validation framework to be extensible and made it available as an open source project together with two example environments and complete teaching materials. We report on our experiences in two undergraduate modeling courses (approx. 100 students each). Our results are promising in a sense that we detected positive effects of tool adoption and surprising lack thereof\, which we discuss w.r.t. lessons learned and future work.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Industry Days] SysML v2: The New Standard for Model-Based Systems Engineering - Ed Seidewitz
DESCRIPTION:For over a decade\, SysML v1 has been the standard modeling language for systems engineering\, and it has fostered the growing move toward Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). But it is now at its limit for growing and adapting to meet the needs of the systems engineering community – the recently completed SysML 1.7 will be the last point release of v1. So\, for the last five years\, a diverse team of organizations across industry\, government and academia have been working on the second version of SysML – and it is now almost done. How will SysML v2 provide even better support for MBSE? What capabilities will v2 bring beyond those of v1? What needs to be done to transition from v1 to v2? Come and find out!

SUMMARY:[MODELS Industry Days] Academic research to industry practice: success stories and open challenges in model-based approaches - Akshay Rajhans
DESCRIPTION:Computational models have seen a wide adoption in industry over the past decade. This is particularly true for design and analysis of complex engineered systems such as those in automotive and aerospace applications. These days models are being put in use beyond the design phase and into the operation phase. This new paradigm is enabling workflows like digital twins and digital engineering and continuous engineering methods like DevOps. The advent of machine learning components in models brings with it its own challenges such as explainability and robustness. Given where we are today\, where has there been progress in demonstrating practical impact of research results over the past decade and where do open challenges still remain? In this talk we will explore these questions from the perspective of an industry research scientist\, and survey progress and outline open challenges.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Industry Days] Digital Twins and Virtualization: Next Generation V&V Technologies for Automotive Systems - S Ramesh
DESCRIPTION:Automotive systems are making steady progress towards software defined vehicle (SDV) architectures enabling continuous improvement\, integration and deployment of functionality via over-the-air updates (OTA). Safety and the associated verification &amp\; validation of systems undergoing continuous change is a huge challenge. Another challenge is the proliferation of software configurations arising out of on-demand addition of functionality enabled by SDV platforms. Incremental verification and continuous safety assurance are some of the solutions recommended for addressing these problems. This talk will also explore the role of digital twins in the context of model based system engineering of deeply embedded automotive systems.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Industry Days] Model-based network automation: opportunities and challenges - Mojtaba Bagherzadeh
DESCRIPTION:Due to the lack of standard interfaces for networking devices\, their configuration often results in large\, heterogeneous configuration files\, which can lead to misconfigurations and complicate enterprise network management. Misconfigurations are one of the main causes of network failures. For example\, misconfigurations are reported to be responsible for 16/% of Facebook’s production incidents\, and they are the second most prevalent cause of disruptions to Google’s production services. \nModel-based network configuration techniques offer a vendor-neutral and platform-independent way of configuring networking devices. By using configuration models\, network configuration and monitoring can be automated and simplified. Network protocols can also be tested and validated automatically via modeling techniques. During this talk\, I will start by providing an overview of existing model-based configuration languages and methods. Following that\, I will discuss how different stakeholders are adopting these models and the challenges they are facing. To conclude\, I will discuss how the modeling community can contribute to solving these challenges.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Industry Days] RTist in Code – A New Approach to Modeling Real-Time Applications - Mattias Mohlin
DESCRIPTION:Modeling tools for creating real-time applications have been used in the industry for more than 30 years. They have become an essential part in the development process of software for telecom systems\, medical devices\, military systems\, manufacturing machines and many more. The current generation of these tools that are used in the industry today typically run in the Eclipse IDE\, using technologies such as UML\, EMF and GMF for providing modeling support and graphical diagrams. HCL RTist is an example of such a modeling product. Current market trends for development tools\, feedback from users\, and results from research have shown that it may be time to rethink some of the design decisions on which tools such as HCL RTist are built. In this session you will learn about RTist in Code\, the new Art language and other recent innovations that we hope will take modeling of real-time applications to the next level.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Industry Days] How much modeling do we really need? A view on modeling challenges in the automotive industry in the age of the Software-Defined-Vehicle - Maged Khalil
DESCRIPTION:The talk posits a necessary shift in systems and software modeling focus for complex connected future mobility solutions in the age of the “Software-defined-Vehicle”\, and presents some pondering about how much (top-down) modeling (and which types of models) we need in a world of growing (cloud) computing &amp\; simulation power\, enabling digital twins with rapidly increasing parity.

SUMMARY:[MODELS ] Keynote by Akshay Rajhans - Akshay Rajhans
DESCRIPTION:Design as a process in the large combines activities ranging from those that build on intuition to those that are highly mechanical. Automation has traditionally taken an important role in alleviation some of the more menial operations. Artificial Intelligence holds great promise in also assisting the user with their more creative operations or even taking over some of those entirely. Instead of focusing on an exclusively computational design process\, this presentation takes the perspective of human activities in design in an attempt to highlight symbiotic opportunity for combined human/artificial intelligence. A Create\, Organize\, Refine\, Evaluate (CORE) framework is utilized to identify a range of design activities and to provide inspiration for symbiotic support by presenting concrete illustrations of the various activities.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Quantifying the Variability Mismatch Between Problem and Solution Space - Marc Hentze\, Chico Sundermann\, Thomas Thüm\, Ina Schaefer
DESCRIPTION:A software product line allows to derive individual software products based on a configuration. As the number of possible configurations is an indicator for the general complexity of a software product line\, automatic #SAT analyses have been proposed to provide this information. However\, the number of configurations does not need to match the number of products. Due to this mismatch\, using the number of configurations to reason about the technical complexity (i.e.\, the number of products) of a software product line can lead to wrong assumptions during implementation and testing. How to compute the exact number of products\, however\, is unknown. In this paper\, we mitigate this problem and present a concept to derive a solution-space feature model which allows to reuse existing #SAT analyses to compute the number of products of a software product line. We evaluate our concept by applying it to a total of 119 subsystems of three industrial software product lines. The results not only show that the concept scales for real world software product lines\, but also confirm the mismatch between the number of configurations and the number of products.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Modular Language Product Lines. A Graph Transformation Approach - Juan de Lara\, Esther Guerra\, Paolo Bottoni
DESCRIPTION:Modelling languages are intensively used in paradigms like model-driven engineering to automate all tasks of the development process. These languages may have variants\, in which case\, there is the need to deal with language families rather than with individual languages. However\, specifying the syntax and semantics of each language variant separately is costly\, hinders reuse across variants\, and may yield inconsistent semantics between variants. \nTo attack this problem\, we propose a novel\, modular way to describe product lines of modelling languages. Our approach is compositional\, enabling the incremental definition of language families by means of modules comprising meta-model fragments\, graph transformation rules\, and rule extensions. Language variants are configured by selecting the desired modules\, which entails the composition of a language meta-model and a set of rules defining its semantics. This paper describes a theory that guarantees consistent semantics among all languages within the family\, an implementation as an Eclipse plugin\, and an evaluation reporting drastic effort reduction with respect to an enumerative approach.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Practical Multiverse Debugging through User-defined Reductions: Application to UML Models - Matthias Pasquier\, Ciprian Teodorov\, Frédéric Jouault\, Matthias Brun\, Luka Le Roux\, Loïc Lagadec
DESCRIPTION:Multiverse debugging is an extension of classical debugging methods\, particularly adapted to non-deterministic systems. Recently\, a language-independent formalization was proposed. Moreover\, multiverse debugging is particularly beneficial for specification and design languages\, such as UML. However\, this method suffers from scalability issues during breakpoint lookup. This problem arises due to the exhaustive exploration performed on the potentially infinite state-space of the system. \nIn this paper\, we tackle this problem by introducing Reduced Multiverse Debugging\, an extension proposing a way for the user to define reducing policies used during breakpoint lookup. We enrich the formalization of multiverse debugging with a modular breakpoint lookup strategy\, which allows the integration of the reduction policy. We validate our approach by implementing a practical UML Statechart debugger in the AnimUML web framework. We show several ways the reduction can be applied\, using methods such as predicate abstraction for breakpoint lookup on an infinite state-space\, removing irrelevant variables\, or creating classes of equivalent values. Moreover\, we show the possibility to integrate probabilistic reduction strategies. Relying on hash collisions\, these strategies can be iteratively refined to increase precision.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Modelling Program Verification Tools for Software Engineers - Sophie Lathouwers\, Vadim Zaytsev
DESCRIPTION:In software engineering models are used for many different things. In this paper\, we focus on program verification\, where we use models to reason about the correctness of systems. There are many different types of program verification techniques which provide different correctness guarantees. We investigate the different types of program verification tools that exist\, and present a concise megamodel to distinguish them. We also present a data set of over 350 program verification tools. This data set includes the type of verification tool according to our megamodel\, practical information such as input/output format and repository links\, and more. The categorisation makes it easier to find similar tools and compare them. We also identify trends for each level in our megamodel based on the categorisation. Our data set can be used by software engineers to enter the world of program verification and find a verification tool based on their needs and wants.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Automatic Test Amplification for Executable Models - Faezeh Khorram\, Erwan Bousse\, Jean-Marie Mottu\, Gerson Sunyé\, Pablo Gómez-Abajo\, Pablo C Canizares\, Esther Guerra\, Juan de Lara
DESCRIPTION:Behavioral models are important assets that must be thoroughly verified early in the design process. This can be achieved with manually-written test cases that embed carefully hand-picked domain-specific input data. However\, such test cases may not always reach the desired level of quality\, such as high coverage or being able to localize faults efficiently. Test amplification is an interesting emergent approach to improve a test suite by automatically generating new test cases out of existing manually-written ones. Yet\, while ad-hoc test amplification solutions have been proposed for a few programming languages\, no solution currently exists for amplifying the test cases of behavioral models. In this paper\, we fill this gap with an automated and generic approach. Given an executable DSL\, a conforming behavioral model\, and an existing test suite\, the proposed approach generates new regression test cases in three steps: (i) generating new test inputs by applying a set of generic modifiers on the existing test inputs\; (ii) running the model under test with new inputs and generating assertions from the execution traces\; and (iii) selecting the new test cases that increase the mutation score. We provide tool support for the approach atop the Eclipse GEMOC Studio and show its applicability in an empirical study. In the experiment\, we applied the approach to 71 test suites written for models conforming to two different DSLs\, and for 67 of the 71 cases\, it successfully improved the mutation score between 3.17% and 54.11% depending on the initial setup.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Feedback on the Formal Verification of UML Models in an Industrial Context: The Case of a Smart Device Life Cycle Management System - Maxime Méré\, Frédéric Jouault\, Loïc Pallardy\, Richard Perdriau
DESCRIPTION:This paper presents experience feedback on how we managed to formally verify properties on semi-formal models of a Life Cycle Management System (LCMS) for smart devices. These devices are typically structured around a System on Chip (SoC)\, which can provide built-in hardware security. They can offer the possibility to make the deployment of Product-Service Systems (PSSs) to consumers easier\, through traceability and collaborative consumption rule enforcement. A PSS is a business model in which products and services are tightly connected. One of the main advantages of such a PSS is that it optimizes product use\, with a positive environmental impact. Associating the LCMS with a blockchain-based protocol makes it possible to avoid centralization. Semi-formal UML models of such a LCMS\, as well as the properties it must comply with\, were created in order to explore its design space and evaluate the outcomes of specific design choices. However\, the security of the LCMS implementation must be guaranteed\, including protocols and architecture. For that purpose\, these models and properties were later improved to be formally verifiable\, which ensures the security of their implementation at the expense of added complexity. The verification was carried out using two available software tools: VerifPal for the protocol model\, and AnimUML (developed by one of the authors) for the architecture model. This makes the procedure accessible for non-specialists in formal verification. Finally\, our feedback on the whole process as well as on VerifPal is also provided.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Machine learning methods for model classification: A comparative study - José Antonio Hernández López\, Riccardo Rubei\, Jesús Sánchez Cuadrado\, Davide Di Ruscio
DESCRIPTION:In the quest to reuse modeling artifacts\, academics and industry have proposed several model repositories over the last decade. Different storage and indexing techniques have been conceived to facilitate searching capabilities to help users find reusable artifacts that might fit the situation at hand. In this respect\, machine learning (ML) techniques have been proposed as a way to automatically categorize and group large sets of modeling artifacts. This paper reports the results of a comparative study of different ML classification techniques employed to automatically label models stored in models repositories. We have built a framework to systematically compare different ML models (feed-forward neural networks\, graph neural networks\, K-nearest neighbors\, support version machines\, etc.)\, with different model encodings (TF-IDF\, word embeddings\, graphs and paths). We apply this framework to two datasets of about 5\,000 Ecore and 5\,000 UML models. We show that depending on the characteristics of the available datasets (e.g.\, presence of duplicates) and on the goals to be achieved\, specific ML models and encodings perform better than others.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Using the ModelSet dataset to support Machine Learning in Model-Driven Engineering - José Antonio Hernández López\, Javier Luis Cánovas Izquierdo\, Jesús Sánchez Cuadrado
DESCRIPTION:The availability of curated collections of models is essential for the application of techniques like Machine Learning (ML) and Data Analytics to MDE as well as to boost research activities. \nHowever\, many applications of ML to address MDE tasks are currently limited to small datasets. In this demo we will present ModelSet\, a dataset composed of 5\,000 Ecore models and 5\,000 UML models which has been manually labelled to support Machine Learning tasks (http://modelset.github.io). ModelSet is built upon the models collected by the MAR search engine (http://mar-search.org)\, which provides more than 500\,000 models of different types. We will describe the structure of the dataset and we will explain how to use the associated library to develop ML applications in Python. Finally\, we will describe some applications which can be addressed using ModelSet.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Industry Days] An architecture proposal integrating Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) objectives for real time data democratisation - François Thibodeau
DESCRIPTION:In 2016\, Montréal’s Mobility Operation Center Division (DEIGD) became conscious of the rapidly growing complexity of data management and system interface definitions while completing pilot projects on live traffic data collection. Data is often compartmentalized in separated applications\, inaccessible broadly and timely for direct consultation. The DEIGD was looking for a new architecture to integrate various data sources and enable the required scalability. This data is produced by equipment (traffic light controllers\, counters &amp\; detectors\, LED displays) installed and maintained by the city. Many systems are considered safe or mission critical\, most outdated technologically. The primary need for the DEIGD is to maintain and expand the systems over an extensive period (more than 25 years). To achieve this\, we need to: \n \n Maintain a high level of consciousness toward technical debt (for durability and evolutivity) \n Implement\, preferably\, maintainable\, durable and highly scalable systems. \n \nThe DEIGD wanted to answer this fundamental question: How do we prepare for tomorrow’s technologies without knowing the orientation’s outcome? Subjects like vehicle automation and electrification will challenge public organization expertise seriously. How do we prepare for this in an environment that hasn’t changed in 50 years? The conclusions of the various studies and pilot projects identified the following needs: \n \n To implement a central data distribution system and manage “data dictionaries” between data subscribers. \n To develop a data centric distribution system with interfaces only described with data and meta-data. \n  To implement a Data Distribution Service (DDS™) described by OMG as a core engine to “forge” data at the ingestion level.  \n To develop a system’s architectural “tricks” and ingest any data\, enabling the system’s interoperability and evolutivity. \n \nIn conclusion\, the implemented architecture completely decoupled the data from the systems. This data decoupling is fundamental and promotes interoperability at its highest possible level. The DEIGD implemented this architecture in 2021 and is now ready to integrate most of its data collection and is aiming for complete data migration by the end of 2024. The presentation will explain the findings and conclusion of a journey of more than five years to develop the latest data centric distribution system architecture\, thus enabling massive possibilities for futuristic data integration.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Industry Days] An emergent Business and Engineering Process Modeling for a hybrid human-multi-robot  workflow management - Maroua Ben Attia
DESCRIPTION:Internet-of-Things (IoT)\, Artificial Intelligence (AI)\, robotics and mobility have become some of the most popular technical trends. As these technologies can bring automation\, rich data analytics\, and intelligence to current businesses\, which accordingly can contribute to continuous optimization of operations and improvement of efficiency and effectiveness\, more and more organizations have considered these technologies as important pillars to their current operations and are seeking ways to easily implement them. Humanitas brings a comprehensive platform featuring a modular paradigm through combining the speed of low-code development with the power of industry-leading workflow management. The system blueprint is designed through combining different formal Architecture Description Languages (ADLs). The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is used to model some aspects of the system\, while the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is used to define processes and decision making activities. With this particular platform\, building and delivery of enterprise-grade applications on time will be a breeze.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Tools & Demonstrations] Precomputing Reconfiguration Strategies based on Stochastic Timed Game Automata - Hendrik Göttmann\, Birte Caesar\, Lasse Beers\, Malte Lochau\, Andy Schürr\, Alexander Fay
DESCRIPTION:Many modern software systems continuously reconfigure themselves to (self-)adapt to ever-changing environmental contexts. Selecting presumably best-fitting next configurations is\, however\, very challenging\, depending on functional and non-functional criteria like real-time constraints as well as inherently uncertain future contexts which makes greedy one-step decision heuristics ineffective. In addition\, the computational overhead caused by reconfiguration planning at run-time should not outweigh its benefits. On the other hand\, completely pre-planning reconfiguration decisions at design time is also infeasible due to the lack of knowledge about the context behavior. In this paper\, we propose a game-theoretic setting for precomputing reconfiguration decisions under partially uncertain real-time behavior. We employ stochastic timed game automata as reconfiguration model to derive winning strategies which enables the first player (the system) to make fast look-ups for presumably best-fitting reconfiguration decisions satisfying the second player (the context). To cope with the high computational complexity of finding winning strategies\, our tool implementation utilizes the statistical model-checker Uppaal Stratego to approximate near-optimal solutions. In our evaluation\, we investigate efficiency/effectiveness trade-offs by considering a real-world case study consisting of an reconfigurable robot support system for the construction of aircraft fuselages.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Tools & Demonstrations] A Tool for the Automation of Efficient Multi-Robot Choreography Planning and Execution - Eric Roslin Wete Poaka\, Joel Greenyer\, Daniel Kudenko\, Wolfgang Nejdl\, Oliver Flegel\, Dennes Eisner
DESCRIPTION:In the automotive industry\, the design\, modeling\, and planning of multi-robot cells are manual error-prone\, and time-expensive tasks. A recent work investigated\, using reactive synthesis\, approaches to automate robot task planning\, and execution. In this paper\, we present a tool that realizes a model-at-runtime approach. The tool is integrated with a robot simulation tool\, to automate efficient multi-robot choreography planning\, and execution. We illustrate the tool using a multi-robot spot welding cell\, inspired from an industrial case. Given a virtual model of the production cell\, and user constraints definition\, the tool can derive a specification for the GR(1) reactive synthesis. The tool integrates the synthesized controller with the production cell execution\, and in real time\, optimizes the strategies by considering the uncertainties. The system can select among several correct\, and safe actions\, the optimal action using AI-based planning techniques\, such as the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. We showcase our tool\, illustrate its implementation architecture\, including how it can support robot experts for automated planning and execution of production cells.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Tools & Demonstrations] System Architecture Synthesis for Performability by Logic Solvers - Máté Földiák\, Kristóf Marussy\, Daniel Varro\, Istvan Majzik
DESCRIPTION:In model-based systems engineering\, system architectures often have to make compromises to meet hard constraints of functional and extra-functional requirements while optimizing for a target objective. Design space exploration (DSE) techniques have been developed to automatically propose candidate architectures over an extremely large design and configuration space. (1) Meta-heuristic exploration algorithms are often used to provide practical\, best-effort solutions for DSE\, but they lack any guarantees of completeness or optimality. (2) Logic synthesis based approaches may offer strong theoretical guarantees\, but frequently face scalability issues. In the paper\, we propose two logic solver-based approaches to evaluate complex design spaces by using partial models in order to find an optimal solution with respect to performability objectives. One approach uses performability analysis as a post-filtering of valid system architecture candidates\, while the other approach uses performability analysis for guiding the actual search over partial models. We evaluate both approaches on an interferometry mission architecture case study using view transformations for performability analysis and compare our approach with a well-known DSE framework based on meta-heuristic search.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Tools & Demonstrations] Migrating from Proprietary Tools to Open-source Software for EAST-ADL Metamodel Generation and Evolution - Jörg Holtmann\, Jan-Philipp Steghöfer\, Henrik Lönn
DESCRIPTION:Paper Abstract: Open-source software has numerous advantages over proprietary commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software. However\, there are modeling languages\, tool chains\, and tool frameworks that are developed and maintained in an open-source manner but still incorporate COTS tools. Such an incorporation of COTS tools into an overall open-source approach completely annihilates the actual open-source advantages and goals. In this tool paper\, we demonstrate how we eliminated a COTS tool from the otherwise open-source-based generation and evolution workflow of the domain-specific modeling language EAST-ADL\, used in the automotive industry to describe a variety of interdisciplinary aspects of vehicle systems. By switching to a pure open-source solution\, EAST-ADL becomes easier to inspect\, evolve\, and develop a community around. We compare both the mixed COTS/open-source and the open-source-only workflows\, outline the advantages of the open-source-only solution\, and show that we achieve equivalent tooling features compared to the original approach. \nTool and demonstration scenario: In general\, we present our new Eclipse-native generation and evolution workflow for EAST-ADL. \n== Part 1 == We maintain and evolve the EAST-ADL metamodel\, which in our approach relies on Ecore—in contrast to the original approach\, which uses a metamodel with a proprietary file format maintained in a COTS modeling tool. This metamodel serves documentation purposes\, so that we call it “documentation MM” in the paper. Steps of the scenario: - We add new language concepts to the Ecore-based EAST-ADL metamodel and hook them into the language infrastructure by inheritance. - In this context\, we also shortly outline the documentation and visualization capabilities of EcoreTools and compare them to the COTS modeling tool from the original approach. \n== Part 2 == We transform the documentation MM to another Ecore-based EAST-ADL metamodel that serves the deployment in the EAST-ADL modeling environment “EATOP” (where we call the latter metamodel “implementation MM” in the paper). Steps of the scenario: - We execute the transformation. - Compared to the documentation MM from part 1\, we show which structural changes are conducted and which implementation details are added through EAnnotations to the implementation MM. These structural changes and implementation details are expected by the EATOP modeling infrastructure (cf. part 3). - We show further generated artifacts like the XML schema file\, Genmodel\, and plugins encompassing model/edit code. \n== Part 3 == We deploy the implementation MM and the generated plugins to the EATOP modeling infrastructure. Steps of the scenario: - We deploy the newly generated plugins into the development workspace of the EATOP modeling infrastructure. - In the EATOP runtime\, we first show how we create instances of the newly added language concepts. - Furthermore\, we show how the changes that were conducted as part of the transformation from the documentation MM to the implementation MM (cf. part 2) influence the representation in the EATOP runtime in terms of menu structure\, custom serialization format\, and documentation texts.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Tools & Demonstrations] A Diagram-Centric Modeling Tool for Systems of Systems - Sean Kristian Remond Harbo\, Emil Voldby\, Jonas Madsen\, Michele Albano
DESCRIPTION:While System of Systems (SoS) architectures for large and complex software projects are gaining momentum\, the commonly used modeling and tooling approaches are still general-purpose or oriented towards single systems. Developers could benefit from methods and tools that avoid system-centric details in favor of native SoS modeling support. This paper presents a diagram-centric modeling tool with native SoS modeling support. The demonstration will get through the three diagrams &amp\; one document used in our approach. The tool is implemented as a plugin for the Eclipse Papyrus modeling tool. The tool is showcased on a SoS to manage the interaction of users with a library. The code of the plugin is freely available via Github (and it will be submitted to the Artifact Evaluation Committee). A video for the accompanying demo can be found at url{https://youtu.be/RT_9SuwAaRA}.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Verification of Railway Network Models with EVEREST - João Martins\, José M. Fonseca\, Rafael Costa\, José Creissac Campos\, Alcino Cunha\, Nuno Macedo\, Jose Nuno Oliveira
DESCRIPTION:Models - at different levels of abstraction and pertaining to different engineering views - are central in the design of railway networks\, in particular signalling systems. The design of such systems must follow numerous strict rules\, which may vary from project to project and require information from different views. This renders manual verification of railway networks costly and error-prone. \nThis paper presents EVEREST\, a tool for automating the verification of railway network models that preserves the loosely coupled nature of the design process. To achieve this goal\, EVEREST first combines two different views of a railway network model - the topology provided in signalling diagrams containing the functional infrastructure\, and the precise coordinates of the elements provided in technical drawings (CAD) - in a unified model stored in the railML standard format. This railML model is then verified against a set of user-defined topological rules\, written in a custom modal logic that simplifies the specification of spatial constraints in the network. The violated rules can be visualized both in the signalling diagrams and technical drawings\, where the element(s) responsible for the violation are highlighted.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Bug Localization in Game Software Engineering: Evolving Simulations to Locate Bugs in Software Models of Video Games - Rodrigo Casamayor\, Lorena Arcega\, Francisca Pérez\, Carlos Cetina
DESCRIPTION:Video games have characteristics that differentiate their development and maintenance from classic software development and maintenance. These differences have led to the coining of the term Game Software Engineering to name the emerging subfield that intersects Software Engineering and video games. Bug localization is one of these differences. Video game developers perceive more difficulties than other non-game developers when it comes to locating bugs. Our work proposes a promising\, novel way to locate bugs in video games by means of evolving simulations. As the baseline\, we have chosen BLiMEA\, which targets classic software development and uses bug reports and the defect localization principle to locate bugs. We also include Random Search as a sanity check in the evaluation. We evaluate the approaches in a commercial video game released on PC and PlayStation (Kromaia). The results for F-measure range from 46.80%. to 70.28% for five types of bugs. Our approach improved the results of the baseline by 20.29% in F-measure. Our work suggests that the current ideas of leveraging bug reports and the defect localization principle may not be enough to locate bugs in video games. To the best of our knowledge\, this is the first approach that is designed specifically for bug localization in video games. Furthermore\, a focus group with professional video game developers has confirmed the acceptance of our approach. Our approach opens a new research direction for bug localization for both game software engineering and possibly classic software engineering.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] A Comprehensive Framework for the Analysis of Automotive Systems - Alessandro Cimatti\, Sara Corfini\, Luca Cristoforetti\, Marco Di Natale\, Alberto Griggio\, Stefano Puri\, Stefano Tonetta
DESCRIPTION:Analysis models\, technologies and tools are extensively used in the automotive domain to validate and optimize the design and implementation of SW systems. This is especially true for modern systems including advanced autonomous (and complex) features. The range of analysis methods that can be applied is extremely wide and goes from functional correctness to functional safety to timing (and schedulability)\, security\, and possibly even more. The AUTOSAR automotive standard has been defined with the purpose of standardizing the SW architecture of automotive systems and enable the construction of systems by composing SW components that are portable and abstract with respect to the underlying HW/SW platform. However\, AUTOSAR was originally developed with portability of code in mind\, and even if it quickly evolved to include a system-level modeling language (with its metamodel) and later extensions to deal with the needs of analysis methods (and tools)\, it is hardly comprehensive and still affected by several omissions and limitations. To fix the limitations with respect to timing and schedulability analysis Bosch developed the Amalthea (later App4MC) metamodel and tools. In Huawei\, a more general (and ambitious) approach was undertaken to support not only timing analysis\, but also model checking (or other types of formal verification)\, safety analysis and even design optimization. The approach is based on the concepts of a unified (modular) metamodel and a framework based on Eclipse to integrate analysis methods and tools. In this paper we describe the framework and the results obtained with respect to the objectives of functional verification and timing analysis.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Incremental Causal Connection for Self-Adaptive Systems based on Relational Reference Attribute Grammars - René Schöne\, Johannes Mey\, Sebastian Ebert\, Sebastian Götz\, Uwe Aßmann
DESCRIPTION:Even though model-driven engineering reduces complexity during development of self-adaptive systems and models@run.time enables using them during runtime\, connecting models to different external system still involves manual work. However\, those connections are essential to the complete system\, as they enable external systems to react to changes of the internal model and vice versa. In our case\, the model is based on Relational Reference Attribute Grammars\, an extension of Attribute Grammars to enable conceptual models at runtime while retaining their benefits of modular specification and an incremental evaluation scheme. We present an approach to enable concise specification of the causal connection and needed transformations to match required formats or semantics. To show its applicability\, a use-case showing the coordination of multiple industrial robot arms using models is presented. We show\, that\, using our approach\, connections can be specified more concisely while maintaining the same efficiency as hand-written code.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Addressing the Uncertainty Interaction Problem in Software-intensive Systems: Challenges and Desiderata - Javier Camara\, Radu Calinescu\, Betty H.C. Cheng\, David Garlan\, Bradley Schmerl\, Javier Troya\, Antonio Vallecillo
DESCRIPTION:Software-intensive systems are increasingly used to support tasks that are typically characterized by high degrees of uncertainty. The modeling notations employed to design\, verify\, and operate such systems have increasingly started to capture different types of uncertainty\, so that they can be explicitly considered when systems are developed and deployed. While these modeling paradigms consider different sources of uncertainty individually\, these sources are rarely independent\, and their interactions affect the achievement of system goals in subtle and often unpredictable ways. Our article describes the problem of uncertainty interaction in software-intensive systems\, illustrating it on examples from relevant application domains. We then identify key open challenges and define desiderata that future modeling notations and model-driven engineering research should address in order to address these challenges.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] A Value-Based Goal Model Analysis Tool - Carlos Cano Genoves\, Emilio Insfran\, Silvia Abrahão
DESCRIPTION:Goal-oriented analysis techniques analyzes goal models in order to help analysts making decisions about the system to be developed. These analyses can\, for example\, identify conflicts of interest among stakeholders or prioritize their goals. Although many techniques of this type have been proposed\, the vast majority of them focus on the concept of satisfaction\, resulting in a value-neutral approach. This means that all the elements in a goal model (e.g.\, stakeholders’ goals) are considered to be equally important. Moreover\, almost all these techniques use either a qualitative or a quantitative approach to assign weight or importance to the elements in a goal model. \nThis paper presents a tool that provides technical support to a goal-oriented analysis technique that uses the concept of value (thereby considering that not all intentional elements are equally important). The technique uses fuzzy logic to combine a qualitative prioritization of individual intentional elements with a quantitative systematic propagation of the relationships among these intentional elements by means of Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (FMCDM). This propagation calculates how valuable each intentional element of a goal model is with respect to the other elements of the model.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Accelerating Similarity-Based Model Matching Using On-The-Fly Similarity Preserving Hashing - Xiao He\, Letian Tang\, Yutong Li
DESCRIPTION:Similarity-based model matching is the foundation of model versioning. It pairs model elements based on a distance metric (e.g.\, edit distance). Because it is expensive to calculate the distance between two elements\, a similarity-based matcher usually suffers from performance issues when the model size increases. This paper proposes a hash-based approach to accelerate similarity-based model matching. Firstly\, we design a novel similarity-preserving hash function that maps a model element to a 64-bit hash value. If two elements are similar\, their hashes are also very close. Secondly\, we propose a 3-layer index structure and a query algorithm to quickly filter out impossible candidates for the element to be matched based on their hashes. For the remaining candidates\, we employ the classical similarity-based matching algorithm to determine the final matches. Our approach has been realized and integrated into EMF Compare. The evaluation results show that our hash function is effective to preserve the similarity between model elements and our matching approach reduces 16% 72% of time costs while assuring the matching results consistent with EMF Compare.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] An efficient line-based approach for resolving merge conflicts in XMI-based models - Alfonso de la Vega\, Dimitris Kolovos
DESCRIPTION:Conflicts in software artefacts can appear during collaborative development through version control systems. When these conflicts happen in XMI models\, the conflict sections generated by diff programs break the XMI serialisation and compromise the ability to use model editors that assume well-formedness of this serialisation. While these conflict sections already mark the conflicting lines of the model\, current tools for conflict resolution in models ignore them and instead load the different versions of a model from the repository\, over which they perform a full and costly comparison that re-identifies the conflicts. We present a novel approach that prevents this repetition of work by directly parsing XMI-based models with conflict sections\, which allows for a targeted analysis of only the lines of the model that have been detected to be in conflict by the version control system. We have implemented this approach in the PEACEMAKER tool\, which can load XMI models with conflict sections\, compute and display conflicts at the model level\, and provide appropriate resolution actions. Compared with state-of-the-art model comparison tools with support for conflict resolution\, PEACEMAKER is able to identify the vast majority of conflicts in models while reducing the required time by up to 60%. The small subset of non-identified conflicts does not introduce issues into the models\, e.g. there is no loss of model information\, and the resulting models after line-merging these conflicts conform to their metamodels.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] A generic approach to detect design patterns in model transformations using a string-matching algorithm - Chihab eddine Mokaddem\, Houari Sahraoui\, Eugene Syriani
DESCRIPTION:Maintaining software artifacts is a complex and time-consuming task. Like any other program\, model transformations are subject to maintenance. In a maintenance process\, much effort is dedicated to the comprehension of programs. To this end\, several techniques are used\, such as feature location and design pattern detection. In the particular case of model transformations\, detecting design patterns contributes to a better comprehension as they carry valuable information on the transformation structure. In this paper\, we propose a generic approach to detect\, semi-automatically\, design patterns and their variations in model transformations. Our approach encodes both design patterns and transformations as strings and use a string-matching algorithm for the detection. The approach is able to detect complete and partial implementations of design patterns in transformations\, which is useful to refactoring and improving model transformations.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Nested OSTRICH: Hatching Compositions of Low-code Templates - João Costa Seco\, Hugo Lourenço\, Joana Baptista Parreira\, Carla Ferreira
DESCRIPTION:We present a template composition mechanism and its typing and instantiation algorithms for model-driven low-code development environments. We evolve OSTRICH a rich template language for the OutSystems platform to support nested templates. We allow the instantiation (hatching) of templates in the definition of other templates\, thus significantly increasing the potential for code reuse leading to a safer evolution of applications. The present definition seamlessly extends the existing OutSystems metamodel with template constructs expressed by (innocuous) model annotations\, thus maintaining backward compatibility with the existing language toolchain. We present the metamodel\, its annotations\, and the corresponding validation and instantiation algorithms. In particular\, we introduce a type-based validation procedure that ensures that using a template inside a template produces valid models. \nOur presentation is driven by a running example that starts with an application illustrating a common code pattern\, a screen displaying a database table. We progressively use compositions of focused templates that generalise the pattern making the code modular and reusable. The initial application\, and its variants\, can be readily instantiated by using the presented template composition mechanism. \nThe work is validated and compared to the state of the art using the OSTRICH benchmark. Our prototype is an extension of the OutSystems IDE allowing the annotation of models and their use to produce new models. We also analyse which existing OutSystems sample screens templates can be improved by using and sharing nested templates.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Advanced Visualization and Interaction in GLSP-based Web Modeling: Realizing Semantic Zoom and Off-Screen Elements - Giuliano De Carlo\, Philip Langer\, Dominik Bork
DESCRIPTION:Conceptual modeling is widely adopted in industrial practices\, e.g.\, process\, software\, and systems modeling. Providing adequate and usable modeling tools is essential for the efficient adoption of modeling. Metamodeling platforms provide a rich set of functionalities and are mature in realizing state-of-the-art modeling tools. However\, despite their maturity and stability\, most of these platforms only slowly – if at all – leverage the full extent of functionalities and the ease of exploitation and integration enabled by web technologies. With the Graphical Language Server Protocol (GLSP)\, it is now possible to realize much richer\, advanced opportunities for visualizing and interacting with conceptual models. This paper presents a concept and a prototypical implementation of two advanced model visualization and interaction functionalities with the Eclipse GLSP platform: Semantic Zoom and Off-Screen Elements. We believe such advanced functionalities pave the way for a prosperous modeling future and spark innovation in modeling tool development.

Picto Web is a tool designed for complex model exploration. Using the Epsilon Generation Language for model-to-text transformation\, it can transform domain-specific models into multiple transient web-based views in different formats\, such as HTML\, Graphviz\, and PlantUML. Picto Web uses lazy and incremental model-to-text transformation to (re)generate views efficiently. Moreover\, it supports push notifications to clients when views are updated and is packaged as a Docker container for ease of use.

DESCRIPTION:oftware is the main driver of added-value in many of the systems that surround us. While its complexity is increasing\, so is the diversity of systems driven by software. To meet the challenges emerging from this combination\, it is necessary to mobilize increasingly large and heterogeneous multidisciplinary teams\, comprising software experts\, as well as experts from various domains related to the systems driven by software. Hence\, the quality of communication about software between stakeholders of different domains and with different personalities is becoming a key issue for successfully engineering software-intensive systems. The goal of this study\, thus\, is to investigate the effect of the representation of software design models on the communication of design decisions between stakeholders with diverse personality traits. As a result\, this study finds that graphical representations of software design models are better than textual representations in enhancing the communication and increasing the productivity of stakeholders with diverse personalities.

SUMMARY:[MODELS ] Keynote by Danny Tarlow - Danny Tarlow
DESCRIPTION:There is a great appeal in using machine learning to assist in software development\, as it promises to enable the experience of one software engineer to be recorded and then generalized to provide guidance to another. This creates a number of challenges and opportunities for machine learning research. In this talk\, I’ll give an overview of some of our recent work on deep learning in this space\, highlighting the importance of the temporal nature of developers editing software\, imbuing models with understanding of program execution behaviors\, and the challenge of finding the right information to provide as inputs to our models. I’ll cast the challenges in terms of existing and future developer tools.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Model-Checking Legal Contracts with SymboleoPC - Alireza Parvizimosaed\, Marco Roveri\, Aidin Rasti\, Daniel Amyot\, Luigi Logrippo\, John Mylopoulos
DESCRIPTION:Legal contracts specify requirements for business transactions. As any other requirements specification\, contracts may contain errors and violate properties expected by contracting parties. Symboleo was recently proposed as a formal specification language for legal contracts. This paper presents SymboleoPC\, a tool for analyzing Symboleo contracts using model checking. The presentation includes the architecture\, implementation and testing of the tool\, as well as a scalability evaluation with respect to the size of contracts and properties to be checked through a series of experiments. The results suggest that SymboleoPC can be usefully applied to the analysis of formal specifications of real-life contracts.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Predicate Abstractions for Smart Contract Validation - Javier Godoy\, Juan Pablo Galeotti\, Diego Garbervetsky\, Sebastian Uchitel
DESCRIPTION:Smart contracts are immutable programs deployed on the blockchain that can manage significant assets. Because of this\, verification and validation of smart contracts is of vital importance. Indeed\, it is industrial practice to contract independent specialized companies to audit smart contracts before deployment. Auditors typically rely on a combination of tools and built up experience but still fail to identify problems in smart contracts before deployment\, causing significant losses. In this paper\, we propose using predicate abstraction to construct behaviour models for supporting auditor validation of smart contracts. These abstractions can be built automatically from combinations of predicates extracted from the source code and predicates provided by auditors based on exploration hypotheses they elaborate during an audit. We present an Alloy prototype for generating abstractions and an evaluation on two benchmarks to show the feasibility of exposing known bugs in smart contracts using predicate abstractions.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Symboleo2SC: From Legal Contract Specifications to Smart Contracts - Aidin Rasti\, Daniel Amyot\, Alireza Parvizimosaed\, Marco Roveri\, Luigi Logrippo\, John Mylopoulos\, Amal Ahmed Anda
DESCRIPTION:Smart contracts are software systems that monitor and control the execution of legal contracts to ensure compliance with the contracts terms and conditions. They often exploit Internet-of-Things technologies to support their monitoring functions\, and blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of their data. Ethereum and business blockchain platforms\, such as Hyperledger Fabric\, are among the popular choices for smart contract development. However\, there is a substantial gap in the knowledge of smart contracts between developers and legal experts. Symboleo is a formal specification language for legal contracts that was introduced to address this issue. Symboleo specifications directly encode legal concepts such as parties\, obligations\, and powers. In this paper\, we propose a tool-supported method for translating Symboleo specifications into smart contracts. Towards this end\, we have extended the current Symboleo Integrated Development Environment\, implemented the ontology and semantics of Symboleo into a reusable library\, and developed the Symboleo2SC tool to generate Hyperledger Fabric code exploiting this library. Symboleo2SC was evaluated with three sample contracts. Our experimentation with Symboleo2SC shows that legal contract specifications in Symboleo can be fully converted to smart contracts for monitoring purposes. Moreover\, Symboleo2SC helps simplify the smart contract development process\, saves development effort\, and helps reduce opportunities for coding errors.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] A Declarative Modeling Framework for the Deployment and Management of Blockchain Applications - Luciano Baresi\, Giovanni Quattrocchi\, Damian Andrew Tamburri\, Luca Terracciano
DESCRIPTION:The Blockchain technology is increasingly being adopted for running applications on a trustless\, traceable\, and decentralized infrastructure. The deployment and management of these applications require non-trivial efforts given the unique characteristics of the Blockchain infrastructure (i.e.\, immutability) and the complexity of the software systems being executed. Approaches dedicated to the management of Blockchain applications are still in their early days: practitioners use “manual” solutions that are error-prone\, difficult to maintain and evolve. Moreover\, some applications may only be partially deployed on a Blockchain\, calling for a unified approach that could leverage the operations on different infrastructures (e.g.\, Cloud and Blockchain). \nThis paper presents a declarative framework\, called KATENA\, for the deployment and management of Blockchain applications KATENA provides i) a metamodel for defining Blockchain infrastructures and applications\, ii) reusable workflows for the deployment and management of Blockchain software components along with traditional ones\, iii) an implementation of the approach based on TOSCA\, a standard language for Infrastructure-as-Code\, and xOpera\, an orchestrator compatible with TOSCA. To demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of this approach\, we used KATENA to model and deploy three real-world Blockchain applications.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Panel] Is Lowcode succeeding where we are failing? - Antonio Cicchetti\, Ed Seidewitz\, Jean-Michel Bruel\, Maria Angela Ferrario\, Richard Paige\, UIrich Frank
DESCRIPTION:Low-code is universally recognized as one of the most recent approaches to democratizing software development in the era of professional skill shortage. Low-code potentially opens the software engineering field to a broader community that\, in general\, could meet a barrier due to a shortage of qualified personnel in programming. Many characterizing concepts and foundations are in common with model-driven engineering\, which seems to be losing the quest due to limited usability\, excessive accidental complexity\, and lack of flexibility. On the other hand\, modeling is unavoidable in several domains where rigor and formality are essential. The panelists will provide their views and counter-arguments in analyzing the Low-code phenomena identifying the reasons for getting or not getting inspired by it.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Digital Twin as Risk Free Experimentation Aid for Techno-socio-economic Systems - Souvik Barat\, Vinay Kulkarni\, Tony Clark\, Balbir Barn
DESCRIPTION:Environmental uncertainties and hyperconnectivity force techno-socio-economic systems to introspect and adapt to succeed and survive. Current practice is chiefly intuition-driven which is inconsistent with the need for precision and rigor. We propose that this can be addressed through the use of digital twins by combining results from Modelling &amp\; Simulation\, Artificial Intelligence\, and Control Theory to create a risk free in silico experimentation aid to help: (i) understand why system is the way it is\, (ii) be prepared for possible outlier conditions\, and (iii) identify plausible solutions for mitigating the outlier conditions in an evidence-backed manner. We use reinforcement learning to systematically explore the digital twin solution space. Our proposal is significant because it advances the effective use of digital twin to new problem domains that have greater impact potential. Our novel approach contributes a meta model for simulatable digital twin of industry scale techno-socio-economic systems\, agent-based implementation of the digital twin\, and an architecture that serves as a risk-free experimentation aid to support simulation-based evidence-backed decision-making. We also discuss validation of this approach\, associated technology infrastructure\, and architecture through a representative sample of industry-scale real-world use cases.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Digital TwinCity: A Holistic Approach towards Comparative Analysis of Business Processes - Shinobu Saito
DESCRIPTION:As a company digitizes processes in its digital transformation (DX) journey\, it is important to understand changes before and after processes for assessing the success of the journey. This paper proposes a new holistic approach\, Digital TwinCity. By combining software visualization and process mining\, the approach enables you to have an understanding of the relationship between all of the parts of the twin processes (e.g\, before and after processes). After describing a tool implementing the proposed approach\, we introduce its first application in a company.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Towards Model-based Bias Mitigation in Machine Learning - Alfa Yohannis\, Dimitris Kolovos
DESCRIPTION:Models produced by machine learning are not guaranteed to be free from bias\, particularly when trained and tested with data produced in discriminatory environments. The bias can be unethical\, mainly when the data contains sensitive attributes\, such as sex\, race\, age\, etc. Some approaches have contributed to mitigating such biases by providing bias metrics and mitigation algorithms. The challenge is that users have to implement their code in general/statistical programming languages\, which can be demanding for users with little programming and fairness in machine learning experience. We present FairML\, a model-based approach to facilitate bias measurement and mitigation with reduced software development effort. Our evaluation shows that FairML requires fewer lines of code to produce comparable measurement values to the ones made by the baseline code.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] A Domain-Specific Language for Simulation-Based Testing of IoT Edge-to-Cloud Solutions - Jia Li\, Shiva Nejati\, Mehrdad Sabetzadeh\, Michael McCallen
DESCRIPTION:The Internet of things (IoT) is increasingly prevalent in domains such as emergency response\, smart cities and autonomous vehicles. Simulation plays a key role in the testing of IoT systems\, noting that field testing of a complete IoT product may be infeasible or prohibitively expensive. In this paper\, we propose a domain-specific language (DSL) for generating edge-to-cloud simulators. An edge-to-cloud simulator executes the functionality of a large array of edge devices that communicate with cloud applications. Our DSL\, named IoTECS\, is the result of a collaborative project with an IoT analytics company\, Cheetah Networks. The industrial use case that motivates IoTECS is ensuring the scalability of cloud applications by putting them under extreme loads from IoT devices connected to the edge. We implement IoTECS using Xtext and empirically evaluate its usefulness. We further reflect on the lessons learned.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Validating the Correctness of Reactive Systems Specifications Through Systematic Exploration - Dor Ma'ayan\, Shahar Maoz\, Roey Rozi
DESCRIPTION:Reactive synthesis is an automated procedure to obtain a correct-by-construction reactive system from its temporal logic specification. While the synthesized system is guaranteed to be correct w.r.t. the specification\, the specification itself may be incorrect w.r.t. the engineers’ intention or w.r.t. the environment in which the system should execute in. It thus requires validation. \nCombinatorial coverage (CC) is a well-known coverage criterion. Its rationale and key for effectiveness is the empirical observation that in many cases\, the presence of a defect depends on the interaction between a small number of features of the system at hand. \nIn this work we propose a validation approach for a reactive system specification\, based on a systematic combinatorial exploration of the behaviors of a controller that was synthesized from it. Specifically\, we present an algorithm to generate and execute a small scenario suite that covers all tuples of given variable value combinations over the reachable states of the controller. \nWe have implemented our work in the Spectra synthesis environment. We evaluated it over benchmarks from the literature using a mutation approach\, specifically tailored for evaluating scenario suites of temporal specifications for reactive synthesis. The evaluation shows that for pairwise coverage\, our CC algorithm is feasible and provide a 1.7 factor of improvement in mutation score compared to random scenario generation. We further report on a case study with students who have participated in a workshop class at our university and have used our tool to validate their specifications. The case study results demonstrate the potential effectiveness of our work in helping engineers detect real bugs in the specifications they write.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] DescribeML: a tool for describing machine learning datasets - Joan Giner\, Abel Gómez\, Jordi Cabot
DESCRIPTION:Datasets play a central role in the training and evaluation of machine learning (ML) models. But they are also the root cause of many undesired model behaviors\, such as biased predictions. To overcome this situation\, the ML community is proposing a data-centric cultural shift where data issues are given the attention they deserve\, for instance\, proposing standard documentation for datasets. \nIn this sense\, and inspired by these proposals\, we present a model-driven tool to precisely describe machine learning datasets in terms of their structure\, data provenance\, and social concerns. Our tool aims to facilitate any ML initiative to leverage and benefit from this data-centric shift in ML (e.g.\, selecting the most appropriate dataset for a new project or better replicating other ML results). The tool is implemented as a Visual Studio Code plugin\, and it has been published under an open-source license at https://github.com/SOM-Research/DescribeML.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] MoDLF A Model-Driven Deep Learning Framework for Autonomous Vehicle Perception (AVP) - Aon Safdar\, Farooque Azam\, Muhammad Waseem Anwar\, Usman Akram\, Yawar Rasheed
DESCRIPTION:Cost and time-efficient system development is a major challenge in the automotive industry. Although modeling standards like EAST-ADL have shown promising results to expedite system development\, such standards are unable to cope with the growing demands of the automotive industry. A typical example of this phenomenon is autonomous vehicle perception (AVP) where deep learning architectures (DLA) are required for computer vision (CV) tasks like real-time object recognition and detection. However\, existing modeling standards in the automotive industry are unable to manage such CV tasks at a higher abstraction level. Consequently\, system development is currently accomplished through modeling approaches like EAST-ADL while DLA-based CV features for AVP are implemented in isolation at a lower abstraction level. This significantly compromises productivity due to integration challenges. In this article\, we introduce MoDLF - A Model-Driven Deep learning Framework to design deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for AVP tasks. Particularly\, Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is leveraged to propose a metamodel along with a conformant graphical modeling workbench to model deep CNNs for CV tasks in AVP at a higher abstraction level. Furthermore\, Model-To-Text (M2T) transformations are provided to generate executable code for MATLAB and Python. The framework is validated via two case studies on benchmark datasets for key AVP tasks of object recognition and detection. The results prove that MoDLF effectively enables model-driven architectural exploration of deep convnets for AVP system development while supporting integration with renowned existing standards like EAST-ADL.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Assisting in Requirements Goal Modeling: A Hybrid Approach based on Machine Learning and Logical Reasoning - Qixiang Zhou\, Tong Li\, Yunduo Wang
DESCRIPTION:Goal modeling plays an imperative role in early requirements engineering\, which has been investigated for decades. There have been many studies that show the usefulness of requirements goal models. However\, the establishment of goal models is typically done manually\, which is time-consuming and has a steep learning curve. In this paper\, we propose a semi-automatic framework for constructing iStar models\, which is a well-known goal modeling language. Specifically\, we first investigate the practical needs of iStar modelers on the automation of iStar modeling by holding interviews\, based on which we propose an interactive and iterative modeling process. Our proposal takes advantage of human decisions and artificial intelligence algorithms\, respectively\, aiming at achieving low modeling costs while maintaining the quality of models. We then propose a hybrid method for automatically extracting goal model snippets from requirements text\, which implements the automatic tasks of our proposed process. The proposed method combines logical reasoning with deep learning techniques so as to unleash the power of domain knowledge to assist with automation tasks. We have performed a series of experiments for evaluation. The experimental results show that our method achieves the F1-measure of 90.34% for actor entity extraction\, 93.14% for intention entity extraction\, and 83.18% for actor relation extraction\, which can efficiently establish high-quality goal models.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Machine Learning-based Incremental Learning in Interactive Domain Modelling - Rijul Saini\, Gunter Mussbacher\, Jin L.C. Guo\, Jörg Kienzle
DESCRIPTION:In domain modelling\, practitioners manually transform informal requirements written in natural language (problem descriptions) to more concise and analyzable domain models expressed with class diagrams. With automated domain modelling support using existing approaches\, manual modifications may still be required in extracted domain models and problem descriptions to make them more accurate and concise. For example\, educators teaching software engineering courses at universities usually use an incremental approach to build modelling exercises to restrict students in using intended modelling patterns. These modifications result in the evolution of domain modelling exercises over time. To assist practitioners in this evolution\, a synergy between interactive support and automated domain modelling is required. In this paper\, we propose a bot-assisted approach to allow practitioners perform domain modelling quickly and interactively. Furthermore\, we provide an incremental learning strategy empowered by machine learning to improve the accuracy of the bot’s suggestions and extracted domain models by analyzing practitioners’ decisions over time. We evaluate the performance of our bot using test problem descriptions which shows that practitioners can expect to get useful support from the bot when applied to exercises of similar size and complexity\, with precision\, recall\, and F2 scores over 85%. Finally\, we evaluate our incremental learning strategy where we observe a reduction in the required manual modifications by 70% and an improvement of F2 scores of extracted domain models by 4.2% when using our proposed approach and learning strategy together.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Recommending metamodel concepts during modeling activities with pre-trained language models - Martin Weyssow\, Houari Sahraoui\, Eugene Syriani
DESCRIPTION:The design of conceptually sound metamodels that embody proper semantics in relation to the application domain is particularly tedious in model-driven engineering. As metamodels define complex relationships between domain concepts\, it is crucial for a modeler to define these concepts thoroughly while being consistent with respect to the application domain. We propose an approach to assist a modeler in the design of metamodel by recommending relevant domain concepts in several modeling scenarios. Our approach does not require knowledge from the domain or to hand-design completion rules. Instead\, we design a fully data-driven approach using a deep learning model that is able to abstract domain concepts by learning from both structural and lexical metamodel properties in a corpus of thousands of independent metamodels. We evaluate our approach on a test set containing 166 metamodels\, unseen during the model training\, with more than 5000 test samples. Our preliminary results show that the trained model is able to provide accurate top 5 lists of relevant recommendations for concept renaming scenarios. Although promising\, the results are less compelling for the scenario of the iterative construction of the metamodel\, in part because of the conservative strategy we use to evaluate the recommendations.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Finding with NEMO: A Recommender System to Forecast the Next Modeling Operations - Juri Di Rocco\, Claudio Di Sipio\, Phuong T. Nguyen\, Davide Di Ruscio\, Alfonso Pierantonio
DESCRIPTION:Nowadays\, while modeling environments provide users with facilities to specify different kinds of artifacts\, e.g.\, metamodels\, models\, and transformations\, the possibility of learning from previous modeling experiences and being assisted during modeling tasks remains largely unexplored. In this paper\, we propose NEMO\, a recommender system based on an Encoder-Decoder neural network to assist modelers in performing model editing operations. NEMO learns from past modeling activities and performs predictions employing a deep learning technique. Such an algorithm has been successfully applied in machine translation to convert a text from a language to another foreign language and vice versa. An empirical evaluation on a dataset of BPMN change-based persistent model demonstrates that the technique permits learning from existing operations and effectively predicting the next editing operations with considerably high prediction accuracy. In particular\, NEMO gets 0.977 as precision/recall and 0.992 as success rate score by the best performance.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Solving the Instance Model-View Update Problem in AADL - Rakshit Mittal\, Dominique Blouin\, Anish Bhobe\, Soumyadip Bandyopadhyay
DESCRIPTION:The Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is a rich language for modeling embedded systems through several con- structs such as component extension and refinement to promote modularity of component declarations. To ease processing AADL models\, OSATE\, the reference tool for AADL\, defines another model (namely instance model) computed from a base declarative model/s. An instance model is a simple object tree where all information from the declarative model is flattened so that tools can easily use this information to analyze the system. However for modifications\, they have to make changes in the complex declarative model since there is no automated backward transformation (de-instantiation) from instance to declarative models. Since the instance model is a view of the declarative model\, this is a view-update problem. In this paper\, we propose the OSATE Declarative-Instance Mapping Tool (OSATE-DIM1)\, an Eclipse plugin for de-instantiation of AADL models implementing a solution of this view-update problem. We evaluate OSATE-DIM with a benchmark of existing AADL model processing tools and verify the correctness of our de-instantiation transformations. We also discuss how our approach could be use- ful for decompilation of Object-Oriented languages intermediate representations.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] OSATE-DIM Solves the Instance Model View-Update Problem in AADL - Rakshit Mittal\, Dominique Blouin
DESCRIPTION:AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) is a rich modeling language for embedded systems through several constructs such as component extension and refinement to promote modularity of declarative specifications. To ease the processing of AADL models by tools\, OSATE\, the reference tool for AADL\, defines another model computed from declarative models which results in a single tree system where all information is readily available. Tools can efficiently use this readily available information to refine the system. An automated backward transformation (de-instantiation) from instance models to declarative models is missing to update the corresponding declarative specification with the refinements. Since the instance model is a `view’ of the declarative model\, this is a view-update problem. We demonstrate the OSATE Declarative-Instance Mapping Tool (OSATE-DIM)\, to perform incremental de-instantiation in AADL. This tool significantly eases the development of AADL analysis and code generation tools.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Reactive Links Across Multi-Domain Engineering Models - Cosmina-Cristina Ratiu\, Wesley Assunção\, Rainer Haas\, Alexander Egyed
DESCRIPTION:As the engineering world moves towards collaborative model-driven development\, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep all model artifacts synchronized and consistent across a myriad of tools and domains. The existing literature proposes a variety of solutions\, from passive trace links to computing change propagation paths. However\, these solutions require manual propagation and the use of a limited set of tools\, while also lacking the efficiency and granularity required during the development of complex systems. To overcome these limitations\, this paper proposes a solution based on reactive propagation links between property values across multi-domain models managed in different tools. As opposed to the traditional passive links\, the propagation links automatically react to changes during engineering to assure the synchronization and consistency of the models. The feasibility and performance of our solution were evaluated in two practical scenarios. We identified a set of change propagation cases\, all of which could be resolved using our solution\, while also rendering a great improvement in terms of efficiency as compared to manual propagation. The contribution of our solution to the state of the practice is to enhance the engineering process by reducing the burden of manually keeping models synchronized\, eliminating inconsistencies that can be originated in artifacts managed in a variety of tool from different domains.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Awards] 10-year SOSYM MIP - Modeling robustness behavior using aspect-oriented modeling to support robustness testing of industrial systems - Shaukat Ali\, Lionel C. Briand\, Hadi Hemmati
DESCRIPTION:Model-based robustness testing requires precise and complete behavioral\, robustness modeling. For example\, state machines can be used to model software behavior when hardware (e.g.\, sensors) breaks down and be fed to a tool to automate test case generation. But robustness behavior is a crosscutting behavior and\, if modeled directly\, often results in large\, complex state machines. These in practice tend to be error prone and difficult to read and understand. As a result\, modeling robustness behavior in this way is not scalable for complex industrial systems. To overcome these problems\, aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) can be employed to model robustness behavior as aspects in the form of state machines specifically designed to model robustness behavior. In this paper\, we present a RobUstness Modeling Methodology (RUMM) that allows modeling robustness behavior as aspects. Our goal is to have a complete and practical methodology that covers all features of state machines and aspect concepts necessary for model-based robustness testing. At the core of RUMM is a UML profile (AspectSM) that allows modeling UML state machine aspects as UML state machines (aspect state machines). Such an approach\, relying on a standard and using the target notation as the basis to model the aspects themselves\, is expected to make the practical adoption of aspect modeling easier in industrial contexts. We have used AspectSM to model the crosscutting robustness behavior of a videoconferencing system and discuss the benefits of doing so in terms of reduced modeling effort and improved readability.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Awards] 10-year MIP MODELS - From UML and OCL to Relational Logic and Back - Micro Kuhlmann\, Martin Gogolla
DESCRIPTION:anguages like UML and OCL are used to precisely model systems. Complex UML and OCL models therefore represent a crucial part of model-driven development\, as they formally specify the main system properties. Consequently\, creating complete and correct models is a critical concern. For this purpose\, we provide a lightweight model validation method based on efficient SAT solving techniques. In this paper\, we present a transformation from UML class diagram and OCL concepts into relational logic. Relational logic in turn represents the source for advanced SAT-based model instance finders like Kodkod. This paper focuses on a natural transformation approach which aims to exploit the features of relational logic as directly as possible through straitening the handling of main UML and OCL features. This approach allows us to explicitly benefit from the efficient handling of relational logic in Kodkod and to interpret found results backwards in terms of UML and OCL.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Awards] 10-year SOSYM MIP - Model interoperability in building information modelling - Jim Steel\, Robin Drogemuller\, Bianca Toth
DESCRIPTION:The exchange of design models in the design and construction industry is evolving away from 2-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) and paper towards semantically-rich 3-dimensional digital models. This approach\, known as Building Information Modelling (BIM)\, is anticipated to become the primary means of information exchange between the various parties involved in construction projects. From a technical perspective\, the domain represents an interesting study in model-based interoperability\, since the models are large and complex\, and the industry is one in which collaboration is a vital part of business. In this paper\, we present our experiences with issues of model-based interoperability in exchanging building information models between various tools\, and in implementing tools which consume BIM models\, particularly using the industry standard IFC data modelling format. We report on the successes and challenges in these endeavours\, as the industry endeavours to move further towards fully digitised information exchange.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Schema Inference for Multi-Model Data - Pavel Koupil\, Sebastian Hricko\, Irena Holubova
DESCRIPTION:The variety feature of Big Data\, represented by multi-model data\, has brought a new dimension of complexity to all aspects of data management. The need to process a set of distinct but interlinked data models is a challenging task. \nIn this paper\, we focus on the problem of inference of a schema\, i.e.\, the description of the structure of data. While there exist several verified approaches in the single-model world\, their application for multi-model data is not straightforward. We introduce an approach that ensures inference of a common schema of multi-model data capturing their individual specifics. It can infer local integrity constraints as well as intra- and inter-model references. Following the standard features of Big Data\, it can cope with overlapping models\, i.e.\, data redundancy\, and it is designed to process efficiently significant amounts of data. \nTo the best of our knowledge\, ours is the first approach addressing schema inference in the world of multi-model databases.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] EvolveDB - A tool for model driven schema evolution - Torben Eckwert\, Michael Guckert\, Gabriele Taentzer
DESCRIPTION:Requirements for software applications change almost continuously in all phases of the product life cycle\, which leads to a constant adaption of software systems. These changes affect the domain model of the application and usually lead to necessary changes of the underlying database. As a result\, the data stored in this database must also be adapted accordingly. This well-known problem is called schema evolution. Manual schema evolution with low-level SQL scripts contains both time-consuming and error-prone routine tasks and complicated operations that require expert knowledge. Automation promises significant leverage for cost savings and quality improvements. To date\, the most advanced solutions for this problem have focused on operator-based approaches. However\, these approaches do not allow free editing of the database schema\, but require the database administrator to know in advance the exact sequence of all required operations. In this paper\, we present EvolveDB\, an approach to model-driven schema evolution in relational databases\, where the user specifies the evolution steps by freely editing a database model extracted by reverse engineering. EvolveDB analyzes the differences between the status quo and the evolved model structures and generates a data migration script. An initial evaluation with experts shows promising results. A screencast of the demo is available at https://youtu.be/ieXmrDd2nw4.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Editing Support for Software Languages: Implementation Practices in Language Server Protocols - Djonathan Barros\, Sven Peldszus\, Wesley Assunção\, Thorsten Berger
DESCRIPTION:Effectively using software languages\, be it modeling or programming languages\, requires effective editing support. Modern IDEs\, modeling tools\, and code editors typically provide sophisticated support to create\, comprehend\, or modify models and programs of particular languages. Unfortunately\, building such editing support is challenging. While the engineering of languages is well understood and supported by modern\, model-driven techniques (e.g.\, meta-modeling\, model transformations\, and automated mapping between concrete and abstract syntax)\, there is a lack of engineering principles and best practices for realizing their editing support. Especially domain-specific modeling languages often created by smaller organizations or individual developers\, sometimes even for single projects would benefit from better editing support. The language server protocol (LSP) is a recent de facto standard that allows modularizing a languages editing support into a so-called language server. Tooling such as IDEs or modeling tools that support LSP can then reuse a language server\, instead of having to develop\, maintain\, and evolve the editing support by itself. LSP allows disseminating new languages into a myriad of editing tools. A whopping 121 currently existing language servers illustrate the increasing popularity of the standard. Still\, developers would benefit from engineering principles or best practices when implementing editing support for their software language. Recognizing this opportunity\, we investigate a substantial sample of 30 language servers. We study the editing support features provided in relation to the kinds of languages\, as well as we qualitatively analyze their implementations. We contribute a set of engineering challenges and proposed solutions that language engineers can use to create editing support for their domain-specific modeling or programming language.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Survey of Established Practices in the Life Cycle of Domain-Specific Languages - Holger Borum\, Christoph Seidl
DESCRIPTION:Domain-specific languages (DSLs) have demonstrated their usefulness within many domains such as finance\, robotics\, and telecommunication. This success has been exemplified by the publication of a wide range of articles regarding specific DSLs and their merits in terms of improved software quality\, programmer efficiency\, security\, etc. However\, there is little public information on what happens to these DSLs after they are developed and published. The lack of information makes it difficult for a DSL practitioner or tool creator to identify trends\, current practices\, and issues within the field. In this paper\, we seek to establish the current state of a DSL’s life cycle by analysing 30 questionnaire answers from DSL authors on the design and development\, launch\, evolution\, and end of life of their DSL. On this empirical foundation\, we make six recommendations to DSL practitioners\, scholars\, and tool creators on the subjects of user involvement in the design process\, DSL evolution\, and the end of life of DSLs.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] TMI: Tokenomics Made Easy For Web3 Applications - Han Liu\, Xufei Wang\, Bin Wang\, Huixuan Zheng\, Xuchao Liu
DESCRIPTION:The design of tokenomics\, i.e.\, distribution and circulation mechanisms of cryptocurrency tokens\, is a top priority for almost all Web3 applications which relates to their own economic systems via native cryptocurrency tokens. Unfortunately\, while the sustainability of tokenomics largely determines the long-term development of a Web3 application\, the tooling support for the design of it has been far too insufficient. A common practice at the time of writing is to specify tokenomics with a combination of documents\, spreadsheets\, code scripts etc.. In this paper\, we introduce the TMI development platform for the modelling and analysis of Web3 tokenomics. TMI creates a domain-specific language and its graphical development environment for developers to succinctly model crypto-economic relations in a drag-and-drop way. Based on created models\, TMI allows developers to formally analyse their tokenomics via checking fundamental economic properties\, e.g.\, The core team of a project holds less than 20% of the project token in 36 months. A demonstration video of TMI is available at.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Learning UML Database Design and Modeling with AutoER - Sarah Foss\, Tatiana Urazova\, Ramon Lawrence
DESCRIPTION:Designing models for software systems is a complex activity that takes time and practice to master. Supporting students learning design is time-consuming\, and instructors are limited on the amount of feedback they can provide. This work demonstrates a learning system that helps students learn UML modeling to produce database designs. Important features of the system are its ability to auto-evaluate design diagrams based on instructor criteria\, and automatically generate question variants allowing students to practice on their own. The system is integrated into the PrairieLearn learning management system allowing for its deployment at other institutions. The demonstration shows the random question generation\, how students construct database designs\, and the auto-marking capabilities. The system and practice questions are publicly available for instructors to use to help students learn design modeling.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Graphical Projectional Editing in Gentleman - Aurélien Ducoin\, Eugene Syriani
DESCRIPTION:Graphical modeling languages require proper management of position\, size\, and layout. Most modeling editors lack automated support to manage these graphical concrete syntax properties. It is a timeconsuming effort that affects the understandability of the model. Projectional editors prevent end-users from modifying the concrete syntax so they can focus on the modeling task. However\, while they offer multiple notations\, these editors lack support for graphical languages. In this paper\, we present a projectional editor for graphical languages. Our implementation extends the Gentleman editor generator with multiple layouts and interaction-oriented components to generate graphical web editors.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Gamification-based UML Learning Environment in Virtual Reality - Enes Yigitbas\, Maximilian Schmidt\, Antonio Bucchiarone\, Sebastian Gottschalk\, Gregor Engels
DESCRIPTION:Modeling is a key activity in conceptual design and system design which makes learning and understanding modeling languages like the Unified Modeling Language (UML) important. Many interactive UML learning applications exist and also gamification-based alternatives have been proposed in recent years to promote the engagement of learners. However\, none of the existing approaches provide an immersive learning environment that can be used to increase interactivity while learning. As a consequence\, existing UML learning applications can not create a feeling of presence that can positively influence learning outcomes\, and the potential of gamification is not fully exploited. To overcome this problem\, in this demo paper\, we present an immersive gamification-based UML learning environment in Virtual Reality (VR) to practice modeling class diagrams in an interactive way. The VR environment provides minigames and multi-viewpoint modeling features to learn creating class diagrams. The multi-viewpoint component highlights correspondences between a class diagram and a 3D model of an example system. The goal of this approach is to improve the learners’ motivation\, make the learning process an enjoyable experience\, and boost learning outcomes.

SUMMARY:[MODELS Technical Track] Towards the Practical Adoption of LIDL: A Toolchain for Modeling Human-Machine Interface Software Interactions - Ning Ge\, Yunduo Wang\, Yuan Wang\, Yong Wang
DESCRIPTION:The design and implementation of safety-critical human-machine interface (HMI) software typically follow the model-driven development process to guarantee secure reliability pragmatically. Systematic and comprehensive modeling for interactions involved in HMI software is essential when applying the model-driven approach. LIDL Interaction Description Language (LIDL) is an interaction description language well suited to HMI software interaction modeling. Several problems limit the practical adoption of LIDL. LIDL does not have a visual modeling language or debugging tools\, resulting in error-prone and inefficient modeling. In addition\, there is no toolchain to connect it to the subsequent steps in model-driven development\, such as verification and implementation. This paper presents a toolchain developed for LIDL to alleviate the problems it faces in practice. The toolchain consists of three tools\, a visual modeling tool\, a compiler translating LIDL code to Lustre\, and a LIDL debugger. We design the visual modeling tool and debugger to improve LIDL modeling efficiency and the compiler to support the debugger and integrate the LIDL modeling into the whole model-driven development process of the HMI software. Specifically\, the modeling tool uses tables and diagrams to visualize LIDL code\, pragmatically reducing the possibility of introducing modeling errors while maintaining the semantics of LIDL code. We add management features to LIDL models to form a library of model components that modelers can reuse easily. The modeling tool can also automatically convert LIDL models created by modelers into LIDL code. The debugger helps modelers debug LIDL code to locate problems in the model and correct them quickly.
