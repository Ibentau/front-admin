SUMMARY:MODELS Workshops: Session 1: OCL & other textual constraint languages
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nThe MODELS series of conferences is the premier venue for the exchange of innovative technical ideas and experiences relating to model-driven approaches in the development of software-based systems. This year’s edition will provide an opportunity for the modeling community to further advance the foundations of modeling\, and come up with innovative applications of modeling in emerging areas of cyber-physical systems\, embedded systems\, socio-technical systems\, cloud computing\, big data\, machine learning\, security\, open source\, and sustainability. \nFollowing the tradition of previous conferences\, MODELS 2022 will host a number of workshops\, during the three days before the main conference. The workshops will provide a collaborative forum for a group of typically 15 to 30 participants to exchange recent and/or preliminary results\, to conduct intensive discussions on a particular topic\, or to coordinate efforts between representatives of a technical community. They are intended as a forum for lively discussions of innovative ideas\, recent progress\, or practical experience on model-driven engineering for specific aspects\, specific problems\, or domain-specific needs. Each workshop should provide a balanced distribution of its time for both presentations of papers (favoring the attendance of young researchers) and discussions. The duration of these workshops is in general one day\, but we encourage the submission of half-day workshop proposals on focused topics as well. \nNew this year: Best Theme Paper Award \n \nThis year’s conference will feature a Best Theme Paper Award spanning across all tracks. The special theme of this year’s conference is “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Workshops provide an excellent opportunity to contribute to this theme\, as workshop papers tend to be more exploratory and easier to steer towards new avenues. \nWe encourage researchers to submit papers related to the special theme\, regardless of the workshop they are submitting their paper to. We also encourage prospective workshop organizers to reflect on this theme in their workshop proposals. Workshop proposals on related topics—such as socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, and intelligent systems—are especially welcome. \nWorkshop proposals should accommodate the following selection criteria and process for the Best Theme Paper Award. \n \n A paper must be at least 5 pages long to be eligible. \n Each workshop can nominate one candidate paper. This is optional\, as not every workshop will be able to nominate a paper. We suggest you include the way of selection in your workshop proposals\, and decide upon the actual nomination\, or lack thereof\, once the workshop PC has reviewed the submitted papers. \n The workshop chairs will select one paper out of the candidate papers\, and nominate it to the Selection Committee. \n \nFor more information\, please refer to the Best Theme Paper Award page. \nSubmission Process \n \nSubmit your workshop proposal electronically in PDF using the Springer LNCS style through the MODELS EasyChair submission site. \nPlease adhere to the workshop proposal guidelines below\, providing every requested information about the proposed workshop\, using at most five pages. Please include the one-page draft of your planned Call for Papers to the proposal (not included in the five pages). In order to ensure proper coordination with the deadlines of the main conference\, the deadlines specified in Important Dates below have to be respected by your plan for your workshop. \nAn Overleaf template with the suggested structure is available here. (This is a read-only link. In order to work with it\, you need to make a copy of it.) \nProceedings \n \nAs in previous years\, there will be joint workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital Library that include papers from all workshops. For each workshop\, the joint proceedings will include: an opening message from the organizers\, including\, if applicable\, the workshop program committee\, and all peer-reviewed papers presented in the workshop. \nFormatting instructions are available here for both LaTeX and Word users. LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification\, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e.\, \documentclass[sigconf\,review]{acmart})\, and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e.\, \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers\, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments. Papers should have at least 5 pages. We propose page limits of 5 pages for short papers and 10 pages for full papers following the same style and format of the main tracks of the Conference. \nWord users make sure you are using Times New Roman on the body of your text\, author information\, and section titles\; and using Helvetica on the paper title. \nImportant Dates \n \n \n Workshop Proposal Submissions Deadline: March 25 April 1\, 2022 \n Workshop Proposal Acceptance Notification: April 18 April 25\, 2022 \n Submissions deadline: July 20\, 2022 \n Notification of authors: August 19\, 2022 \n Camera-ready deadline: August 26 September 9\, 2022 \n Workshop dates: October 23-25\, 2022 \n \nContact \n \nFor any information\, please contact the workshops co-chairs at: models2022workshops@easychair.org.

SUMMARY:MODELS Workshops: Session 3: Comparison and unification
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nThe MODELS series of conferences is the premier venue for the exchange of innovative technical ideas and experiences relating to model-driven approaches in the development of software-based systems. This year’s edition will provide an opportunity for the modeling community to further advance the foundations of modeling\, and come up with innovative applications of modeling in emerging areas of cyber-physical systems\, embedded systems\, socio-technical systems\, cloud computing\, big data\, machine learning\, security\, open source\, and sustainability. \nFollowing the tradition of previous conferences\, MODELS 2022 will host a number of workshops\, during the three days before the main conference. The workshops will provide a collaborative forum for a group of typically 15 to 30 participants to exchange recent and/or preliminary results\, to conduct intensive discussions on a particular topic\, or to coordinate efforts between representatives of a technical community. They are intended as a forum for lively discussions of innovative ideas\, recent progress\, or practical experience on model-driven engineering for specific aspects\, specific problems\, or domain-specific needs. Each workshop should provide a balanced distribution of its time for both presentations of papers (favoring the attendance of young researchers) and discussions. The duration of these workshops is in general one day\, but we encourage the submission of half-day workshop proposals on focused topics as well. \nNew this year: Best Theme Paper Award \n \nThis year’s conference will feature a Best Theme Paper Award spanning across all tracks. The special theme of this year’s conference is “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Workshops provide an excellent opportunity to contribute to this theme\, as workshop papers tend to be more exploratory and easier to steer towards new avenues. \nWe encourage researchers to submit papers related to the special theme\, regardless of the workshop they are submitting their paper to. We also encourage prospective workshop organizers to reflect on this theme in their workshop proposals. Workshop proposals on related topics—such as socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, and intelligent systems—are especially welcome. \nWorkshop proposals should accommodate the following selection criteria and process for the Best Theme Paper Award. \n \n A paper must be at least 5 pages long to be eligible. \n Each workshop can nominate one candidate paper. This is optional\, as not every workshop will be able to nominate a paper. We suggest you include the way of selection in your workshop proposals\, and decide upon the actual nomination\, or lack thereof\, once the workshop PC has reviewed the submitted papers. \n The workshop chairs will select one paper out of the candidate papers\, and nominate it to the Selection Committee. \n \nFor more information\, please refer to the Best Theme Paper Award page. \nSubmission Process \n \nSubmit your workshop proposal electronically in PDF using the Springer LNCS style through the MODELS EasyChair submission site. \nPlease adhere to the workshop proposal guidelines below\, providing every requested information about the proposed workshop\, using at most five pages. Please include the one-page draft of your planned Call for Papers to the proposal (not included in the five pages). In order to ensure proper coordination with the deadlines of the main conference\, the deadlines specified in Important Dates below have to be respected by your plan for your workshop. \nAn Overleaf template with the suggested structure is available here. (This is a read-only link. In order to work with it\, you need to make a copy of it.) \nProceedings \n \nAs in previous years\, there will be joint workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital Library that include papers from all workshops. For each workshop\, the joint proceedings will include: an opening message from the organizers\, including\, if applicable\, the workshop program committee\, and all peer-reviewed papers presented in the workshop. \nFormatting instructions are available here for both LaTeX and Word users. LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification\, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e.\, \documentclass[sigconf\,review]{acmart})\, and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e.\, \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}).

SUMMARY:MODELS Tutorials: Umple Tutorial
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nWe invite proposals for tutorials to be held at MODELS 2022 as part of its satellite events from October 23 to 28\, 2022. Tutorials provide intensive overviews on topics in the area of model-based software and systems engineering ranging from modeling methodologies and research methods through new modeling tools and technologies to thoughts on the past\, current\, and future development of the modeling discipline. For this year’s edition\, the conference has the special theme “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Thus\, we especially encourage tutorials where model-based engineering intersects with research and applications on\, not exclusively\, socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, artificial intelligence\, digital twins\, Industry/Society 5.0\, and intelligent systems in general. \nAudience \nTutorials target an audience of practitioners\, researchers (academic and industrial)\, students\, and developers familiar with\, and already working with\, modeling techniques. The target audience typically has a strong interest in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)\, including work on improving and evolving modeling languages (such as UML or DSLs)\, developing sophisticated MDE tool support\, and using MDE to develop / test / reverse / maintain complex systems. Potential attendees may also be interested in how modeling has been applied effectively in specialized domains (e.g.\, in the automotive industry)\, and in learning about successful uses of MDE methods in real-world applications. \nTopics \nThe following themes are examples of what is considered relevant for tutorials: \n \n Modeling techniques for specific domains (e.g.\, automobile\, cyber-physical and hybrid systems\, Industry 4.0\, Internet of Things …) \n Modeling methodologies and model-oriented processes (e.g.\, for agile modeling or modeling at scale) \n AI in modeling (including search*based approaches\, machine learning\, planning\, or flexible modeling) \n Presentation of new tools or new versions of old tools (e.g.\, modeling tools\, language workbenches\, model transformation languages\, model verification tools\, model execution tools) \n Dissemination of project results from industry-related projects \n Teaching of model-driven software development \n Research methods in MD* (Model-Driven Development (MDD)\, Model Driven Engineering (MDE)\, Model Driven Software Development (MDSD)\, etc.) \n Modeling for re-engineering and legacy evolution \n Empirical studies in the context of modeling \n User experience in model-based software engineering \n Practical experiences of general interest \n General topics of interest to young researchers\, like presentation skills or research methodologies \n \nFurthermore\, we also welcome and encourage submissions related to this year’s theme: Modeling for social good. \nTutorials are intended to provide independent instructions on a topic of relevance to the audience described above. Therefore\, no sales-oriented presentations will be accepted. Tutorials relating to commercial tools or involving the use of commercial tools may be accepted\, but will be subject to closer scrutiny\, including possible approval of presentation slides. Potential presenters should keep in mind that there may be quite a varied audience\, including novice graduate students\, seasoned practitioners\, and specialized researchers. Tutorial speakers should be prepared to cope with this diversity.

SUMMARY:MODELS Workshops: Session 3: MPM4CPS
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nThe MODELS series of conferences is the premier venue for the exchange of innovative technical ideas and experiences relating to model-driven approaches in the development of software-based systems. This year’s edition will provide an opportunity for the modeling community to further advance the foundations of modeling\, and come up with innovative applications of modeling in emerging areas of cyber-physical systems\, embedded systems\, socio-technical systems\, cloud computing\, big data\, machine learning\, security\, open source\, and sustainability. \nFollowing the tradition of previous conferences\, MODELS 2022 will host a number of workshops\, during the three days before the main conference. The workshops will provide a collaborative forum for a group of typically 15 to 30 participants to exchange recent and/or preliminary results\, to conduct intensive discussions on a particular topic\, or to coordinate efforts between representatives of a technical community. They are intended as a forum for lively discussions of innovative ideas\, recent progress\, or practical experience on model-driven engineering for specific aspects\, specific problems\, or domain-specific needs. Each workshop should provide a balanced distribution of its time for both presentations of papers (favoring the attendance of young researchers) and discussions. The duration of these workshops is in general one day\, but we encourage the submission of half-day workshop proposals on focused topics as well. \nNew this year: Best Theme Paper Award \n \nThis year’s conference will feature a Best Theme Paper Award spanning across all tracks. The special theme of this year’s conference is “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Workshops provide an excellent opportunity to contribute to this theme\, as workshop papers tend to be more exploratory and easier to steer towards new avenues. \nWe encourage researchers to submit papers related to the special theme\, regardless of the workshop they are submitting their paper to. We also encourage prospective workshop organizers to reflect on this theme in their workshop proposals. Workshop proposals on related topics—such as socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, and intelligent systems—are especially welcome. \nWorkshop proposals should accommodate the following selection criteria and process for the Best Theme Paper Award. \n \n A paper must be at least 5 pages long to be eligible. \n Each workshop can nominate one candidate paper. This is optional\, as not every workshop will be able to nominate a paper. We suggest you include the way of selection in your workshop proposals\, and decide upon the actual nomination\, or lack thereof\, once the workshop PC has reviewed the submitted papers. \n The workshop chairs will select one paper out of the candidate papers\, and nominate it to the Selection Committee. \n \nFor more information\, please refer to the Best Theme Paper Award page. \nSubmission Process \n \nSubmit your workshop proposal electronically in PDF using the Springer LNCS style through the MODELS EasyChair submission site. \nPlease adhere to the workshop proposal guidelines below\, providing every requested information about the proposed workshop\, using at most five pages. Please include the one-page draft of your planned Call for Papers to the proposal (not included in the five pages). In order to ensure proper coordination with the deadlines of the main conference\, the deadlines specified in Important Dates below have to be respected by your plan for your workshop. \nAn Overleaf template with the suggested structure is available here. (This is a read-only link. In order to work with it\, you need to make a copy of it.) \nProceedings \n \nAs in previous years\, there will be joint workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital Library that include papers from all workshops. For each workshop\, the joint proceedings will include: an opening message from the organizers\, including\, if applicable\, the workshop program committee\, and all peer-reviewed papers presented in the workshop. \nFormatting instructions are available here for both LaTeX and Word users. LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification\, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e.\, \documentclass[sigconf\,review]{acmart})\, and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e.\, \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers\, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments. Papers should have at least 5 pages. We propose page limits of 5 pages for short papers and 10 pages for full papers following the same style and format of the main tracks of the Conference. \nWord users make sure you are using Times New Roman on the body of your text\, author information\, and section titles\; and using Helvetica on the paper title. \nImportant Dates \n \n \n Workshop Proposal Submissions Deadline: March 25 April 1\, 2022 \n Workshop Proposal Acceptance Notification: April 18 April 25\, 2022 \n Submissions deadline: July 20\, 2022 \n Notification of authors: August 19\, 2022 \n Camera-ready deadline: August 26 September 9\, 2022 \n Workshop dates: October 23-25\, 2022 \n \nContact \n \nFor any information\, please contact the workshops co-chairs at: models2022workshops@easychair.org.

They are intended as a forum for lively discussions of innovative ideas\, recent progress\, or practical experience on model-driven engineering for specific aspects\, specific problems\, or domain-specific needs. Each workshop should provide a balanced distribution of its time for both presentations of papers (favoring the attendance of young researchers) and discussions. The duration of these workshops is in general one day\, but we encourage the submission of half-day workshop proposals on focused topics as well. \nNew this year: Best Theme Paper Award \n \nThis year’s conference will feature a Best Theme Paper Award spanning across all tracks. The special theme of this year’s conference is “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Workshops provide an excellent opportunity to contribute to this theme\, as workshop papers tend to be more exploratory and easier to steer towards new avenues. \nWe encourage researchers to submit papers related to the special theme\, regardless of the workshop they are submitting their paper to. We also encourage prospective workshop organizers to reflect on this theme in their workshop proposals. Workshop proposals on related topics—such as socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, and intelligent systems—are especially welcome. \nWorkshop proposals should accommodate the following selection criteria and process for the Best Theme Paper Award. \n \n A paper must be at least 5 pages long to be eligible. \n Each workshop can nominate one candidate paper. This is optional\, as not every workshop will be able to nominate a paper. We suggest you include the way of selection in your workshop proposals\, and decide upon the actual nomination\, or lack thereof\, once the workshop PC has reviewed the submitted papers. \n The workshop chairs will select one paper out of the candidate papers\, and nominate it to the Selection Committee. \n \nFor more information\, please refer to the Best Theme Paper Award page. \nSubmission Process \n \nSubmit your workshop proposal electronically in PDF using the Springer LNCS style through the MODELS EasyChair submission site. \nPlease adhere to the workshop proposal guidelines below\, providing every requested information about the proposed workshop\, using at most five pages. Please include the one-page draft of your planned Call for Papers to the proposal (not included in the five pages). In order to ensure proper coordination with the deadlines of the main conference\, the deadlines specified in Important Dates below have to be respected by your plan for your workshop. \nAn Overleaf template with the suggested structure is available here. (This is a read-only link. In order to work with it\, you need to make a copy of it.) \nProceedings \n \nAs in previous years\, there will be joint workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital Library that include papers from all workshops. For each workshop\, the joint proceedings will include: an opening message from the organizers\, including\, if applicable\, the workshop program committee\, and all peer-reviewed papers presented in the workshop. \nFormatting instructions are available here for both LaTeX and Word users. LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification\, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e.\, \documentclass[sigconf\,review]{acmart})\, and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e.\, \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers\, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments. Papers should have at least 5 pages. We propose page limits of 5 pages for short papers and 10 pages for full papers following the same style and format of the main tracks of the Conference. \nWord users make sure you are using Times New Roman on the body of your text\, author information\, and section titles\; and using Helvetica on the paper title. \nImportant Dates \n \n \n Workshop Proposal Submissions Deadline: March 25 April 1\, 2022 \n Workshop Proposal Acceptance Notification: April 18 April 25\, 2022 \n Submissions deadline: July 20\, 2022 \n Notification of authors: August 19\, 2022 \n Camera-ready deadline: August 26 September 9\, 2022 \n Workshop dates: October 23-25\, 2022 \n \nContact \n \nFor any information\, please contact the workshops co-chairs at: models2022workshops@easychair.org.

SUMMARY:MODELS Workshops: Session 1: MDE for AI
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nThe MODELS series of conferences is the premier venue for the exchange of innovative technical ideas and experiences relating to model-driven approaches in the development of software-based systems. This year’s edition will provide an opportunity for the modeling community to further advance the foundations of modeling\, and come up with innovative applications of modeling in emerging areas of cyber-physical systems\, embedded systems\, socio-technical systems\, cloud computing\, big data\, machine learning\, security\, open source\, and sustainability. \nFollowing the tradition of previous conferences\, MODELS 2022 will host a number of workshops\, during the three days before the main conference. The workshops will provide a collaborative forum for a group of typically 15 to 30 participants to exchange recent and/or preliminary results\, to conduct intensive discussions on a particular topic\, or to coordinate efforts between representatives of a technical community. They are intended as a forum for lively discussions of innovative ideas\, recent progress\, or practical experience on model-driven engineering for specific aspects\, specific problems\, or domain-specific needs. Each workshop should provide a balanced distribution of its time for both presentations of papers (favoring the attendance of young researchers) and discussions. The duration of these workshops is in general one day\, but we encourage the submission of half-day workshop proposals on focused topics as well. \nNew this year: Best Theme Paper Award \n \nThis year’s conference will feature a Best Theme Paper Award spanning across all tracks. The special theme of this year’s conference is “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Workshops provide an excellent opportunity to contribute to this theme\, as workshop papers tend to be more exploratory and easier to steer towards new avenues. \nWe encourage researchers to submit papers related to the special theme\, regardless of the workshop they are submitting their paper to. We also encourage prospective workshop organizers to reflect on this theme in their workshop proposals. Workshop proposals on related topics—such as socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, and intelligent systems—are especially welcome. \nWorkshop proposals should accommodate the following selection criteria and process for the Best Theme Paper Award. \n \n A paper must be at least 5 pages long to be eligible. \n Each workshop can nominate one candidate paper. This is optional\, as not every workshop will be able to nominate a paper. We suggest you include the way of selection in your workshop proposals\, and decide upon the actual nomination\, or lack thereof\, once the workshop PC has reviewed the submitted papers. \n The workshop chairs will select one paper out of the candidate papers\, and nominate it to the Selection Committee. \n \nFor more information\, please refer to the Best Theme Paper Award page. \nSubmission Process \n \nSubmit your workshop proposal electronically in PDF using the Springer LNCS style through the MODELS EasyChair submission site. \nPlease adhere to the workshop proposal guidelines below\, providing every requested information about the proposed workshop\, using at most five pages. Please include the one-page draft of your planned Call for Papers to the proposal (not included in the five pages). In order to ensure proper coordination with the deadlines of the main conference\, the deadlines specified in Important Dates below have to be respected by your plan for your workshop. \nAn Overleaf template with the suggested structure is available here. (This is a read-only link. In order to work with it\, you need to make a copy of it.) \nProceedings \n \nAs in previous years\, there will be joint workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital Library that include papers from all workshops. For each workshop\, the joint proceedings will include: an opening message from the organizers\, including\, if applicable\, the workshop program committee\, and all peer-reviewed papers presented in the workshop. \nFormatting instructions are available here for both LaTeX and Word users. LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification\, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e.\, \documentclass[sigconf\,review]{acmart})\, and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e.\, \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers\, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments. Papers should have at least 5 pages. We propose page limits of 5 pages for short papers and 10 pages for full papers following the same style and format of the main tracks of the Conference. \nWord users make sure you are using Times New Roman on the body of your text\, author information\, and section titles\; and using Helvetica on the paper title. \nImportant Dates \n \n \n Workshop Proposal Submissions Deadline: March 25 April 1\, 2022 \n Workshop Proposal Acceptance Notification: April 18 April 25\, 2022 \n Submissions deadline: July 20\, 2022 \n Notification of authors: August 19\, 2022 \n Camera-ready deadline: August 26 September 9\, 2022 \n Workshop dates: October 23-25\, 2022 \n \nContact \n \nFor any information\, please contact the workshops co-chairs at: models2022workshops@easychair.org.

SUMMARY:MODELS Workshops: Session 3: MLE Workshop
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nThe MODELS series of conferences is the premier venue for the exchange of innovative technical ideas and experiences relating to model-driven approaches in the development of software-based systems. This year’s edition will provide an opportunity for the modeling community to further advance the foundations of modeling\, and come up with innovative applications of modeling in emerging areas of cyber-physical systems\, embedded systems\, socio-technical systems\, cloud computing\, big data\, machine learning\, security\, open source\, and sustainability. \nFollowing the tradition of previous conferences\, MODELS 2022 will host a number of workshops\, during the three days before the main conference. The workshops will provide a collaborative forum for a group of typically 15 to 30 participants to exchange recent and/or preliminary results\, to conduct intensive discussions on a particular topic\, or to coordinate efforts between representatives of a technical community. They are intended as a forum for lively discussions of innovative ideas\, recent progress\, or practical experience on model-driven engineering for specific aspects\, specific problems\, or domain-specific needs. Each workshop should provide a balanced distribution of its time for both presentations of papers (favoring the attendance of young researchers) and discussions. The duration of these workshops is in general one day\, but we encourage the submission of half-day workshop proposals on focused topics as well. \nNew this year: Best Theme Paper Award \n \nThis year’s conference will feature a Best Theme Paper Award spanning across all tracks. The special theme of this year’s conference is “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Workshops provide an excellent opportunity to contribute to this theme\, as workshop papers tend to be more exploratory and easier to steer towards new avenues. \nWe encourage researchers to submit papers related to the special theme\, regardless of the workshop they are submitting their paper to. We also encourage prospective workshop organizers to reflect on this theme in their workshop proposals. Workshop proposals on related topics—such as socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, and intelligent systems—are especially welcome. \nWorkshop proposals should accommodate the following selection criteria and process for the Best Theme Paper Award. \n \n A paper must be at least 5 pages long to be eligible. \n Each workshop can nominate one candidate paper. This is optional\, as not every workshop will be able to nominate a paper. We suggest you include the way of selection in your workshop proposals\, and decide upon the actual nomination\, or lack thereof\, once the workshop PC has reviewed the submitted papers. \n The workshop chairs will select one paper out of the candidate papers\, and nominate it to the Selection Committee. \n \nFor more information\, please refer to the Best Theme Paper Award page. \nSubmission Process \n \nSubmit your workshop proposal electronically in PDF using the Springer LNCS style through the MODELS EasyChair submission site. \nPlease adhere to the workshop proposal guidelines below\, providing every requested information about the proposed workshop\, using at most five pages. Please include the one-page draft of your planned Call for Papers to the proposal (not included in the five pages). In order to ensure proper coordination with the deadlines of the main conference\, the deadlines specified in Important Dates below have to be respected by your plan for your workshop. \nAn Overleaf template with the suggested structure is available here. (This is a read-only link. In order to work with it\, you need to make a copy of it.) \nProceedings \n \nAs in previous years\, there will be joint workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital Library that include papers from all workshops. For each workshop\, the joint proceedings will include: an opening message from the organizers\, including\, if applicable\, the workshop program committee\, and all peer-reviewed papers presented in the workshop. \nFormatting instructions are available here for both LaTeX and Word users. LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification\, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e.\, \documentclass[sigconf\,review]{acmart})\, and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e.\, \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers\, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments. Papers should have at least 5 pages. We propose page limits of 5 pages for short papers and 10 pages for full papers following the same style and format of the main tracks of the Conference. \nWord users make sure you are using Times New Roman on the body of your text\, author information\, and section titles\; and using Helvetica on the paper title. \nImportant Dates \n \n \n Workshop Proposal Submissions Deadline: March 25 April 1\, 2022 \n Workshop Proposal Acceptance Notification: April 18 April 25\, 2022 \n Submissions deadline: July 20\, 2022 \n Notification of authors: August 19\, 2022 \n Camera-ready deadline: August 26 September 9\, 2022 \n Workshop dates: October 23-25\, 2022 \n \nContact \n \nFor any information\, please contact the workshops co-chairs at: models2022workshops@easychair.org.

SUMMARY:MODELS Tutorials: Digital twin
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nWe invite proposals for tutorials to be held at MODELS 2022 as part of its satellite events from October 23 to 28\, 2022. Tutorials provide intensive overviews on topics in the area of model-based software and systems engineering ranging from modeling methodologies and research methods through new modeling tools and technologies to thoughts on the past\, current\, and future development of the modeling discipline. For this year’s edition\, the conference has the special theme “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Thus\, we especially encourage tutorials where model-based engineering intersects with research and applications on\, not exclusively\, socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, artificial intelligence\, digital twins\, Industry/Society 5.0\, and intelligent systems in general. \nAudience \nTutorials target an audience of practitioners\, researchers (academic and industrial)\, students\, and developers familiar with\, and already working with\, modeling techniques. The target audience typically has a strong interest in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)\, including work on improving and evolving modeling languages (such as UML or DSLs)\, developing sophisticated MDE tool support\, and using MDE to develop / test / reverse / maintain complex systems. Potential attendees may also be interested in how modeling has been applied effectively in specialized domains (e.g.\, in the automotive industry)\, and in learning about successful uses of MDE methods in real-world applications. \nTopics \nThe following themes are examples of what is considered relevant for tutorials: \n \n Modeling techniques for specific domains (e.g.\, automobile\, cyber-physical and hybrid systems\, Industry 4.0\, Internet of Things …) \n Modeling methodologies and model-oriented processes (e.g.\, for agile modeling or modeling at scale) \n AI in modeling (including search*based approaches\, machine learning\, planning\, or flexible modeling) \n Presentation of new tools or new versions of old tools (e.g.\, modeling tools\, language workbenches\, model transformation languages\, model verification tools\, model execution tools) \n Dissemination of project results from industry-related projects \n Teaching of model-driven software development \n Research methods in MD* (Model-Driven Development (MDD)\, Model Driven Engineering (MDE)\, Model Driven Software Development (MDSD)\, etc.) \n Modeling for re-engineering and legacy evolution \n Empirical studies in the context of modeling \n User experience in model-based software engineering \n Practical experiences of general interest \n General topics of interest to young researchers\, like presentation skills or research methodologies \n \nFurthermore\, we also welcome and encourage submissions related to this year’s theme: Modeling for social good. \nTutorials are intended to provide independent instructions on a topic of relevance to the audience described above. Therefore\, no sales-oriented presentations will be accepted. Tutorials relating to commercial tools or involving the use of commercial tools may be accepted\, but will be subject to closer scrutiny\, including possible approval of presentation slides. Potential presenters should keep in mind that there may be quite a varied audience\, including novice graduate students\, seasoned practitioners\, and specialized researchers. Tutorial speakers should be prepared to cope with this diversity.

SUMMARY:MODELS Educators Symposium: Session 3 - EduSymp 
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nModel-driven engineering has been part of university curricula and corporate training programs for many years. Modeling notations are taught in various courses and programs\, from software engineering to enterprise architecture. Most educators would agree that teaching modeling is challenging\, especially given the growing student population interested in modeling. \nThe 18th Educators Symposium at MODELS 2022 provides educators\, researchers\, and practitioners with a forum to discuss educational issues relating to modeling and modeling technologies and share their experiences in the field. \nTopics \nWe invite submissions related to the following questions and topics: \n \n Challenges in teaching modeling: \n   \n   How to engage students in modeling? \n   How to integrate modeling across the curriculum\, from introduction to programming to senior project and beyond? \n   What appropriate and novel modeling technologies are currently used to enrich the student experience? \n   How to relate or mix theory and practice when teaching modeling? \n   What are effective learning and teaching mechanisms for distance and online learning? \n   How to teach modeling in blended\, virtual\, or massive open online courses? \n   Is teaching modeling using a collaborative approach feasible? \n    \n Tool support for the teaching of modeling \n Tool support for an assisted evaluation of modeling labs or exam \n Modeling Best Practices for beginners \n The relation between modeling research and modeling education \n Incorporating a practitioner viewpoint in modeling education \n Use of case studies or explicative examples to teach modeling \n Teaching global or open-source software engineering modeling \n Evolution of teaching modeling and use of tools in the classroom \n Teaching model-driven engineering and model management \n Teaching verification and validation through models \n The synergy between informal models and formal models in teaching \n How to learn from the number of available uml models to teach modeling (~200 UML per minute on plantuml.com) \n The analysis of teaching methods\, use of tools\, or games for modeling in the classroom. \n \nFor this year’s edition\, the conference has the special theme “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Thus\, we especially encourage contributions where model-based engineering intersects with research and applications on\, not exclusively\, socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, artificial intelligence\, digital twins\, Industry/Society 5.0\, and intelligent systems in general. Papers are eligible for the Best Theme Paper Award.

SUMMARY:MODELS Doctoral Symposium: Session 1 - DocSymp
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nThe goal of the MODELS 2022 Doctoral Symposium is to provide an international forum for doctoral students to interact with their fellow students and faculty mentors working in the area of model-based engineering. The symposium supports students by providing independent and constructive feedback about their already completed and\, more importantly\, planned research work. The Symposium will be attended by prominent experts in the field of model-based engineering\, who will actively participate in critical and constructive discussions. \nThe Symposium will have the format of a one-day workshop\, with presentations of the doctoral students who have their papers accepted in a peer-review process\, feedback from the mentors\, and plenty of time for discussion. The presentations will be open for mentors\, students\, and other conference participants\; only supervisors of the presenters are excluded from the sessions in which their students deliver their presentations. \nMODELS 2022 Doctoral Symposium is planned to be hybrid with the goal of being more inclusive and to increase engagement. \nFor this year’s edition\, the conference has the special theme “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Thus\, we especially encourage contributions where model-based engineering intersects with research and applications on\, not exclusively\, socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, artificial intelligence\, digital twins\, Industry/Society 5.0\, and intelligent systems in general. Papers are eligible for the Best Theme Paper Award.

SUMMARY:MODELS Workshops: Session 1: Opening and Keynote
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nThe MODELS series of conferences is the premier venue for the exchange of innovative technical ideas and experiences relating to model-driven approaches in the development of software-based systems. This year’s edition will provide an opportunity for the modeling community to further advance the foundations of modeling\, and come up with innovative applications of modeling in emerging areas of cyber-physical systems\, embedded systems\, socio-technical systems\, cloud computing\, big data\, machine learning\, security\, open source\, and sustainability. \nFollowing the tradition of previous conferences\, MODELS 2022 will host a number of workshops\, during the three days before the main conference. The workshops will provide a collaborative forum for a group of typically 15 to 30 participants to exchange recent and/or preliminary results\, to conduct intensive discussions on a particular topic\, or to coordinate efforts between representatives of a technical community. They are intended as a forum for lively discussions of innovative ideas\, recent progress\, or practical experience on model-driven engineering for specific aspects\, specific problems\, or domain-specific needs. Each workshop should provide a balanced distribution of its time for both presentations of papers (favoring the attendance of young researchers) and discussions. The duration of these workshops is in general one day\, but we encourage the submission of half-day workshop proposals on focused topics as well. \nNew this year: Best Theme Paper Award \n \nThis year’s conference will feature a Best Theme Paper Award spanning across all tracks. The special theme of this year’s conference is “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Workshops provide an excellent opportunity to contribute to this theme\, as workshop papers tend to be more exploratory and easier to steer towards new avenues. \nWe encourage researchers to submit papers related to the special theme\, regardless of the workshop they are submitting their paper to. We also encourage prospective workshop organizers to reflect on this theme in their workshop proposals. Workshop proposals on related topics—such as socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, and intelligent systems—are especially welcome. \nWorkshop proposals should accommodate the following selection criteria and process for the Best Theme Paper Award. \n \n A paper must be at least 5 pages long to be eligible. \n Each workshop can nominate one candidate paper. This is optional\, as not every workshop will be able to nominate a paper. We suggest you include the way of selection in your workshop proposals\, and decide upon the actual nomination\, or lack thereof\, once the workshop PC has reviewed the submitted papers. \n The workshop chairs will select one paper out of the candidate papers\, and nominate it to the Selection Committee. \n \nFor more information\, please refer to the Best Theme Paper Award page. \nSubmission Process \n \nSubmit your workshop proposal electronically in PDF using the Springer LNCS style through the MODELS EasyChair submission site. \nPlease adhere to the workshop proposal guidelines below\, providing every requested information about the proposed workshop\, using at most five pages. Please include the one-page draft of your planned Call for Papers to the proposal (not included in the five pages). In order to ensure proper coordination with the deadlines of the main conference\, the deadlines specified in Important Dates below have to be respected by your plan for your workshop. \nAn Overleaf template with the suggested structure is available here. (This is a read-only link. In order to work with it\, you need to make a copy of it.) \nProceedings \n \nAs in previous years\, there will be joint workshop proceedings in the ACM Digital Library that include papers from all workshops. For each workshop\, the joint proceedings will include: an opening message from the organizers\, including\, if applicable\, the workshop program committee\, and all peer-reviewed papers presented in the workshop. \nFormatting instructions are available here for both LaTeX and Word users. LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification\, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e.\, \documentclass[sigconf\,review]{acmart})\, and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e.\, \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers\, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments. Papers should have at least 5 pages. We propose page limits of 5 pages for short papers and 10 pages for full papers following the same style and format of the main tracks of the Conference. \nWord users make sure you are using Times New Roman on the body of your text\, author information\, and section titles\; and using Helvetica on the paper title. \nImportant Dates \n \n \n Workshop Proposal Submissions Deadline: March 25 April 1\, 2022 \n Workshop Proposal Acceptance Notification: April 18 April 25\, 2022 \n Submissions deadline: July 20\, 2022 \n Notification of authors: August 19\, 2022 \n Camera-ready deadline: August 26 September 9\, 2022 \n Workshop dates: October 23-25\, 2022 \n \nContact \n \nFor any information\, please contact the workshops co-chairs at: models2022workshops@easychair.org.

SUMMARY:MODELS Workshops: Session 3: LowCode
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nThe MODELS series of conferences is the premier venue for the exchange of innovative technical ideas and experiences relating to model-driven approaches in the development of software-based systems. This year’s edition will provide an opportunity for the modeling community to further advance the foundations of modeling\, and come up with innovative applications of modeling in emerging areas of cyber-physical systems\, embedded systems\, socio-technical systems\, cloud computing\, big data\, machine learning\, security\, open source\, and sustainability. \nFollowing the tradition of previous conferences\, MODELS 2022 will host a number of workshops\, during the three days before the main conference. The workshops will provide a collaborative forum for a group of typically 15 to 30 participants to exchange recent and/or preliminary results\, to conduct intensive discussions on a particular topic\, or to coordinate efforts between representatives of a technical community. They are intended as a forum for lively discussions of innovative ideas\, recent progress\, or practical experience on model-driven engineering for specific aspects\, specific problems\, or domain-specific needs. Each workshop should provide a balanced distribution of its time for both presentations of papers (favoring the attendance of young researchers) and discussions. The duration of these workshops is in general one day\, but we encourage the submission of half-day workshop proposals on focused topics as well. \nNew this year: Best Theme Paper Award \n \nThis year’s conference will feature a Best Theme Paper Award spanning across all tracks. The special theme of this year’s conference is “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Workshops provide an excellent opportunity to contribute to this theme\, as workshop papers tend to be more exploratory and easier to steer towards new avenues. \nWe encourage researchers to submit papers related to the special theme\, regardless of the workshop they are submitting their paper to. We also encourage prospective workshop organizers to reflect on this theme in their workshop proposals. Workshop proposals on related topics—such as socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, and intelligent systems—are especially welcome. \nWorkshop proposals should accommodate the following selection criteria and process for the Best Theme Paper Award. \n \n A paper must be at least 5 pages long to be eligible. \n Each workshop can nominate one candidate paper. This is optional\, as not every workshop will be able to nominate a paper. We suggest you include the way of selection in your workshop proposals\, and decide upon the actual nomination\, or lack thereof\, once the workshop PC has reviewed the submitted papers. \n The workshop chairs will select one paper out of the candidate papers\, and nominate it to the Selection Committee. \n \nFor more information\, please refer to the Best Theme Paper Award page. \nSubmission Process \n \nSubmit your workshop proposal electronically in PDF using the Springer LNCS style through the MODELS EasyChair submission site. \nPlease adhere to the workshop proposal guidelines below\, providing every requested information about the proposed workshop\, using at most five pages.

SUMMARY:MODELS Workshops: Session 2: MASE Workshop
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nThe MODELS series of conferences is the premier venue for the exchange of innovative technical ideas and experiences relating to model-driven approaches in the development of software-based systems. This year’s edition will provide an opportunity for the modeling community to further advance the foundations of modeling\, and come up with innovative applications of modeling in emerging areas of cyber-physical systems\, embedded systems\, socio-technical systems\, cloud computing\, big data\, machine learning\, security\, open source\, and sustainability. \nFollowing the tradition of previous conferences\, MODELS 2022 will host a number of workshops\, during the three days before the main conference. The workshops will provide a collaborative forum for a group of typically 15 to 30 participants to exchange recent and/or preliminary results\, to conduct intensive discussions on a particular topic\, or to coordinate efforts between representatives of a technical community. They are intended as a forum for lively discussions of innovative ideas\, recent progress\, or practical experience on model-driven engineering for specific aspects\, specific problems\, or domain-specific needs. Each workshop should provide a balanced distribution of its time for both presentations of papers (favoring the attendance of young researchers) and discussions. The duration of these workshops is in general one day\, but we encourage the submission of half-day workshop proposals on focused topics as well. \nNew this year: Best Theme Paper Award \n \nThis year’s conference will feature a Best Theme Paper Award spanning across all tracks. The special theme of this year’s conference is “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG.

SUMMARY:MODELS Tools & Demonstrations: Systems Eng. & Analysis I
DESCRIPTION:MODELS Tools & Demonstrations: Systems Eng. & Analysis I\nSession Chair(s): Iulian Ober\n\nAbout \n \nMODELS is the premier conference series for model-based software and systems engineering. Since 1998 MODELS has been covering all aspects of modeling\, from languages and methods to tools and applications. Since the inception of the conference\, the development of tools to support modeling activities has been an integral part of the research activities with many of these tools evolving into modeling platforms that support the development of new tools. The demonstration of tools at recent MODELS conferences has shown that both researchers and practitioners dedicate more time and effort to developing high-quality tools to be used by the community and industry. It is also accepted that the availability of tools is a primary factor for the adoption of model-driven engineering approaches. \nWith this call\, we solicit high-quality submissions for the tool demonstration track of MODELS 2022\, ranging across commercial\, academic\, and corporate research as well as industrial systems. We encourage submissions on tools that are: research prototypes built to support novel research ideas\, extensions of existing tools and toolchains\, mature tools as well as pedagogical tools that support the teaching of model-driven approaches. Any of the MODELS topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Furthermore\, we also welcome submissions related to this year’s theme: modeling for social good. \nThe submissions to this track should not have been demonstrated at other venues and extensions of existing tools should be substantial. Based on the purpose of the tool\, submissions will be evaluated on their technical merit\, novelty\, pedagogical impact\, relevance to the modeling community\, and potential for use in real-world applications. In all cases\, particular attention will be given on the quality of the proposed demonstrations. Of course\, at least one of the authors must attend the demonstration session in order to present the tool and discuss it with attendees. \nFor this year’s edition\, the conference has the special theme “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Thus\, we especially encourage contributions where model-based engineering intersects with research and applications on\, not exclusively\, socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, artificial intelligence\, digital twins\, Industry/Society 5.0\, and intelligent systems in general. Papers are eligible for the Best Theme Paper Award.

SUMMARY:MODELS ACM Student Research Competition: SRC posters
DESCRIPTION:\n\nAbout \n \nMODELS 2022 will host an ACM Student Research Competition (SRC). The ACM SRC is a forum for undergraduate and graduate students to present their original research\, exchange ideas\, and improve their communication skills while competing for prizes at MODELS 2022. The Student Research Competition has the following goals (for general information on the ACM SRC see https://src.acm.org/): \n \n To give undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to share their research ideas and results at MODELS in a special forum that provides visibility for their work \n To give students the opportunity to meet with and interact with MODELS attendees to share ideas\, gain new insights\, and understand possible practical applications \n To give students an opportunity to sharpen their communication skills\, including visual\, organizational\, oral\, and aural modalities \n To provide detailed feedback to students about their research and presentation\, from a panel of distinguished judges \n To recognize and reward outstanding student research \n \nParticipation Requirements \n \n \n Participants must be undergraduate or graduate students pursuing an academic degree (i.e.\, they must be enrolled in a university or college) at the time of initial submission. \n Participants must have an active ACM student membership\, and must provide their ACM member number. \n Supervisors of the work may not be listed as co-authors\; students must submit a single-authored version of their work for the competition. \n The contest has two categories\, one for undergraduate research and the other for graduate research. Three winners will be selected in each category. Research completed while the student was an undergraduate may be submitted to the undergraduate category even if the student is now a first-year graduate student. \n Team projects will be accepted from Undergraduate students. One person should be designated by the team to attend the conference and make the oral presentation. Should the designated presenter win first\, second or third place in competition only they will receive the medal and monetary award. Only individual research is accepted from Graduate (Masters or PhD program) students\; group research projects will not be considered. If an individual is part of a group research project and wants to participate in an SRC\, they can only present their part of the research. Only they will receive the medal and monetary award (should they win). \n Students may only participate in one SRC per program year (April 1- March 31). Students that have applied to an SRC\, but have not been accepted\, may respond to other SRC calls for participation during the program year. \n

SUMMARY:MODELS Panel: Panel
DESCRIPTION:MODELS Panel: Panel\nSession Chair(s): Antonio Cicchetti\n\nIs Lowcode succeeding where we are failing? \nLow-code is universally recognized as one of the most recent approaches to democratizing software development in the era of professional skill shortage. Low-code potentially opens the software engineering field to a broader community that\, in general\, could meet a barrier due to a shortage of qualified personnel in programming. Many characterizing concepts and foundations are in common with model-driven engineering\, which seems to be losing the quest due to limited usability\, excessive accidental complexity\, and lack of flexibility. On the other hand\, modeling is unavoidable in several domains where rigor and formality are essential. The panelists will provide their views and counter-arguments in analyzing the Low-code phenomena identifying the reasons for getting or not getting inspired by it. \nPanelists \n \n Ed Seidewitz\, Model Driven Solutions \n Jean-Michel Bruel\, University Toulouse 2 Jean Jaurès \n Maria Angela Ferrario\, Queen’s University Belfast \n Richard Paige\, McMaster University \n Ulrich Frank\, University of Duisburg-Essen \n \nModerator \nThe panel will be chaired by Antonio Cicchetti\, Mälardalen University

SUMMARY:MODELS Technical Track: Foundations III
DESCRIPTION:MODELS Technical Track: Foundations III\nSession Chair(s): Daniel Varro\n\nAbout \n \nContributions related to all aspects of modeling\, modeling languages and model-based software and systems engineering are cordially invited to the 25th edition of MODELS\, in Montreal\, Canada 16-21 October 2022. \nMODELS is the premier conference series for model-based software and systems engineering. Since 1998\, MODELS has covered all aspects of modeling\, from languages and methods\, to tools and applications. Attendees of MODELS come from diverse backgrounds\, including researchers\, academics\, engineers\, and industrial professionals. MODELS 2022 is a forum for participants to exchange cutting-edge research results and innovative practical experiences around modeling\, modeling languages\, and model-based software and systems engineering. \nAs in previous years\, MODELS 2022 is offering two tracks for technical papers: the Foundations Track and the Practice &amp\; Innovation Track. \nThis year’s edition will provide an opportunity for the modeling community to further advance the foundations of modeling\, and come up with innovative applications of modeling in emerging areas of cyber-physical systems\, embedded systems\, socio-technical systems\, cloud computing\, big data\, machine learning\, security\, open source\, and sustainability. \nFor this year’s edition\, the conference has the special theme “Modeling for social good” #MDE4SG. Thus\, we especially encourage contributions where model-based engineering intersects with research and applications on\, not exclusively\, socio-technical systems\, tools with social impact\, integrating human values\, data science\, artificial intelligence\, digital twins\, Industry/Society 5.0\, and intelligent systems in general. Papers are eligible for the Best Theme Paper Award. \nWe invite you to join us at MODELS 2022\, Montreal\, Canada and to help shape the modeling languages\, methods\, and technologies of the future! \nTopics of Interest (but not restricted to) \n \nMODELS 2022 seeks submissions on diverse topics related to modeling for software and systems engineering\, including\, but not limited to: \n \n Foundations of model-based engineering\, including definition of syntax and semantics of modeling languages and model transformation languages. \n New paradigms\, formalisms\, applications\, approaches\, frameworks\, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development\, digital twins\, etc. \n Definition\, usage\, and analysis of model-based generative and re-engineering approaches. \n Models@Runtime: model-based monitoring\, analysis\, and adaptation towards intelligent systems\, e.g.\, with digital shadows or digital twins. \n Development of model-based systems engineering approaches and modeling-in-the-large including interdisciplinary engineering and coordination. \n Applications of AI to model-based engineering problems including e.g.\, search-based and machine learning approaches. \n Model-based engineering foundations for AI-based systems. \n Human and organizational factors in model-based engineering. \n Tools\, meta-tools\, and language workbenches for model-based engineering\, including model management and scalable model repositories. \n Integration of modeling languages and tools (hybrid multi-modeling approaches). \n Evaluation and comparison of modeling languages\, techniques\, and tools. \n Quality assurance (analysis\, testing\, verification) for functional and non-functional properties of models and model transformations. \n Collaborative modeling research to address global and team management issues (e.g.\, browser-based and cloud-enabled collaboration). \n Evolution of modeling languages and related standards. \n Evidence-based education research for curricular concerns on modeling topics. \n Modeling in software engineering\; applications of models to address general software engineering challenges. \n Modeling for specific challenges such as collaboration\, scalability\, security\, interoperability\, adaptability\, flexibility\, maintainability\, dependability\, reuse\, energy efficiency\, sustainability\, and uncertainty. \n Modeling with\, and for\, new and emerging systems and paradigms such as security\, cyber-physical systems (CPSs)\, the Internet of Things (IoTs)\, cloud computing\, DevOps\, data analytics\, data science\, machine learning\, big data\, systems engineering\, socio-technical systems\, critical infrastructures and services\, robotics\, mobile applications\, conversational agents\, open-source software\, sustainability and modeling for social good. \n Empirical studies of applying model-based engineering for domains such as smart production\, smart cities\, smart enterprises\, smart mobility\, smart society\, etc. \n \nAttendance \n \nIf a submission is accepted\, at least one author of the paper is required to attend the conference and present the paper in person.
